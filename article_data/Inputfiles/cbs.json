The strike in Beirut's residential Bashoura district hit a multi-story apartment building that houses an office of the Health Society, a group of civilian first responders affiliated with Hezbollah.It was the second airstrike to hit central Beirut this week, and the second to hit the Health Society in 24 hours. The Associated Press said no Israeli warning was issued to the area before the strike. Residents reported a sulfur-like smell, and Lebanon's state-run National News Agency accused Israel of using\u00a0phosphorous bombs\u00a0in the strike, which are prohibited by international law for use near civilian populations.\u00a0Human rights groups have in the past\u00a0accused Israel of using white phosphorus\u00a0incendiary shells on towns and villages in conflict-hit southern Lebanon.\nA man takes pictures of damaged buildings and debris in the aftermath of an Israeli strike, amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in Beirut's southern suburbs, Lebanon, Oct. 3, 2024.\n\n            \n                Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS\n\n                          \nThe Israel Defense Forces issued a statement Wednesday night saying it had \"conducted a precise strike in Beirut,\" but there was no further information about the attack.

The IDF issued\u00a0new evacuation orders Thursday for 25 towns and villages in southern Lebanon, bringing the number of communities from which residents have been told to flee this week, since Israeli ground operations began in the area, to 77.\u00a0The Israeli Air Force said in a statement Thursday that \"approximately 15 Hezbollah terrorists were eliminated\" in a strike on a local government building in Bing Jbeil, southern Lebanon, which the IAF said was being used by the militant group.Israel announced Monday that it was launching\u00a0ground incursions\u00a0into southern Lebanon, ramping up its fight against Hezbollah while continuing its devastating war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\u00a0Israel's air and ground operations in Gaza killed more than 50 people near the city of Khan Younis on Wednesday, including children, according to Palestinian health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.\u00a0\n\n\nThe war in the densely packed Palestinian territory has killed more than 41,500 people since it was sparked almost a year ago by Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack.\u00a0\nInjured children are carried on a stretcher at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Deir Al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, Oct. 2, 2024.\n\n            \n                Ramadan Abed/REUTERS\n\n                          \nThe fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2014 a much larger, better armed group than Hamas \u2014 was described by the IDF on Wednesday as intense, as it confirmed eight soldiers had died in the operations.The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict in Middle East.Iran's ambassador to the U.N. said his country had launched nearly 200 missiles at Israel on Tuesday as a deterrent to further Israeli violence. His Israeli counterpart called the barrage an \"unprecedented act of aggression.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, while an Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel did so.President Biden said Wednesday that the U.S. and its other partners were in discussions with Netanyahu's government about Israel's pending response to the Iranian attack, which Mr. Biden has stressed should be \"in proportion\" to Iran's missile salvo, which was largely thwarted by the U.S. ally's advanced missile defense systems.\u00a0Mr. Biden said he would not support an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the missile attack, but that the U.S. and its global allies supported Israel's right to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden weighs in on Iran attack, port strikes and Helene destruction\n08:27\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that Iran's attack was \"totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it,\" but that \"Israel, with the active support of the United States and other partners, effectively defeated this attack.\"\n\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have traded fire across the southern Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, which saw terrorists kill 1,200 Israelis and take 251 more as hostages into Gaza, according to the Israeli government. The fighting has increased dramatically over the last two weeks, since Israel was accused of blowing up thousands of Hezbollah members' communications devices and assassinating the group's senior leader in a targeted strike in Beirut.Countries prepare for evacuations from LebanonThe escalating bloodshed in Lebanon has prompted some governments to hastily prepare evacuation plans for their citizens from the country.The British government has chartered more flights to help U.K. nationals leave Lebanon a day after an evacuation flight left Beirut. The government said in a statement that the flights would continue as \"long as the security situation allows\" and that it was working to increase capacity on commercial flights for British nationals.Around 700 British troops, Foreign Office staff and Border Force officers have been deployed to a British military base in Cyprus to help with evacuation plans. British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under the age of 18 are eligible for the chartered evacuation flights.\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, right, is seen   with British military officers in the Joint Planning Room of the HMS Duncan naval destroyer, in the eastern Mediterranean, during a visit to Cyprus amid planning for the evacuation of British nationals from Lebanon, Oct. 2, 2024.\n\n            \n                Yui Mok/Getty\n\n                          \nJapan on Thursday dispatched two Self Defense Force planes to prepare for a possible airlift of Japanese citizens from Lebanon, while Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said her government had booked 500 seats on commercial aircraft for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families to leave Lebanon on Saturday.Speaking Monday, Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder said while the U.S. State Department had issued no blanket evacuation order for Americans in Lebanon, the military always plans \"for all contingencies.\"The State Department has had a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory in effect for Lebanon\u00a0for more than a week, warning U.S. nationals not to visit the country and those already there to seek commercial travel options to get out.

Here's what to know and the cases to watch.", "Author": "Melissa Quinn; Editor(s): Melissa Quinn", "Date": "October 3, 2024 / 1:37 PM EDT", "content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will kick off its new term Monday, taking the bench for the first time since the justices handed down blockbuster decisions over the summer on guns, a widely used abortion pill, the regulatory power of federal agencies and presidential immunity.The upcoming term, which will stretch into June 2025, is shaping up so far to be quieter than the Supreme Court's last. But the justices are still poised to hear cases on hot-button issues like LGBTQ rights, an age-verification law for pornographic websites and the Biden administration's efforts to combat gun violence.And looming over the start of the new term is the November election, which could bring legal battles over the presidential contest before the high court. The justices have already been asked to intervene in disputes over Arizona's proof-of-citizenship voting requirements and efforts by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and\u00a0independent Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to be restored to the ballots in Nevada and New York, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court returns to the bench facing steady criticism for some of its most significant rulings, beginning with its June 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and continuing with the July ruling granting former President Donald Trump some level of immunity from federal prosecution. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have also been under scrutiny from Congress over their adherence to ethics laws and practices.Calls to reform the Supreme Court have followed criticism of the justices and their rulings. President Biden came out in favor of 18-year term limits and an enforceable code of ethics for the justices, as well as a constitutional amendment clarifying that former presidents are not immune from federal prosecution. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, backs the reforms and has urged Congress to act.\n\n\nWhile the differences among the justices are typically revealed to the public through their written opinions and dissents, recent leaks to the media have provided a window into the court's internal deliberations, and some of the justices have not shied away from voicing their frustrations.\u00a0In addition to the shocking and unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion reversing Roe, the New York Times reported in September on internal memos and discussions surrounding three cases that involved Trump, including the immunity ruling that has sparked significant pushback against the high court.Lisa Blatt, a lawyer who has argued 50 cases before the Supreme Court, said during a Federalist Society event that \"something does feel broken,\" and observed that some of the justices \"feel visibly frustrated\" during oral arguments.Here are four cases to watch in the Supreme Court's new term:\n\n\nNew rules for ghost guns\nGhost guns are displayed at the headquarters of the San Francisco Police Department on Nov. 27, 2019.\n\n            \n                Haven Daley / AP\n\n                          \nOn the second day of the term, Oct. 8, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Garland v. VanDerStok, a challenge to a regulation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that imposed requirements on the makers and sellers of untraceable firearms known as ghost guns. The case doesn't involve the Second Amendment, but instead revolves around whether the ATF went too far when it issued its measure regulating the weapons.Ghost guns are unserialized firearms that can be assembled from kits sold online, and there has been a surge in the number of these firearms recovered by law enforcement each year, according to the Biden administration.\u00a0Implemented by the ATF in April 2022, the rule amended the definition of \"firearm\" under the 1968 Gun Control Act to include certain weapon parts kits. It also clarified that partially complete frames and receivers that can be converted into functional firearms qualify as regulated weapons.The measure subjects covered manufacturers and sellers to the same rules that apply to commercial gun sales and requires them to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers, run background checks and keep purchase records. It applies to all untraceable firearms, including those made with 3D printers or sold as assembly kits.Shortly after the rule took effect, a group of gun owners, advocacy groups and ghost gun distributors sued the ATF, arguing it overstepped its authority. The challengers prevailed before a district judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which invalidated the portion of the rule defining \"frame or receiver\" and found the 1968 Gun Control Act's definition of \"firearm\" doesn't include weapon parts kits.The Biden administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court and is urging the justices to reverse the 5th Circuit.The justices have already intervened in the case on an emergency basis. In a divided 5-4 decision, the high court paused the district court's decision invalidating the rule, allowing it to take effect while litigation played out. Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in allowing the Justice Department to enforce the measure.\n\n\nThat order will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues a decision in the case, expected by the end of June 2025.An Oklahoma death row inmate's bid for a new trial\nRichard Glossip in a Feb. 19, 2021, photo provided by Oklahoma Department of Corrections.\n\n            \n                Oklahoma Department of Corrections via AP\n\n                          \nDeath row inmate Richard Glossip's bid for a new trial will be before the justices on Oct. 9. The case is known as Glossip v. Oklahoma, and it's unique in the fact that the state's Republican attorney general has argued that Glossip's murder conviction and death sentence shouldn't stand because of issues with his trial.Nine execution dates have been set for Glossip and he has had his \"last meal\" three times, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. His most recent execution date was in May 2023, but the Supreme Court blocked it\u00a0after the attorney general, Gentner Drummond, said he didn't receive a fair trial.Glossip was convicted in the 1997 killing of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where he worked. He was found guilty in two different trials, though his first conviction was reversed due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In both instances, the prosecution relied on the testimony of Glossip's co-defendant, Justin Sneed, who admitted to robbing and killing Van Treese but said Glossip hired him to carry out the murder.Sneed was sentenced to life in prison.An independent counsel investigated Glossip's case and raised issues with Sneed's credibility as a witness. Evidence previously withheld by the state and made available to the defense in January showed that Sneed was evaluated by a jail psychiatrist and diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder in 1997, after the murder and while he was in jail. Sneed was prescribed lithium by the psychiatrist. Interview notes from 2003, which Drummond said were not turned over by the state, indicated the prosecutor knew about Sneed's treatment.The attorney general said Sneed testified during Glossip's second trial in 2004 that he had never seen a psychiatrist. That information, as well as that he received lithium for a psychiatric condition, may have impacted how the jury viewed Sneed as a witness, according to the attorney general.\n\n\nDrummond told the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board in April that he supported clemency for Glossip, citing the independent reviews of the case that suggested he receive a new trial. But the parole board voted not to recommend clemency. The attorney general also asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to wipe away Glossip's conviction, though it, too, rejected the request.This is not the first time Glossip has been before the Supreme Court. In 2015, he unsuccessfully challenged Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. Justice Neil Gorsuch is sitting out of the court's consideration of the case, likely because of his prior stint as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Oklahoma.Tennessee's ban on sex-transition treatments\u00a0The most closely watched case of the term, U.S. v. Skrmetti, involves a Tennessee law that bans certain sex-transition treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. A decision could have wide-ranging impacts \u2014 more than 20 states have enacted laws in recent years limiting access to treatments like puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy or surgeries.Tennessee's law, SB1, was enacted in March and bars health care providers from prescribing, administering or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone if the treatment is meant to \"enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex\" or treat \"purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity.\"\u00a0Puberty-blockers or hormones can also be used to treat conditions like precocious puberty, disease, a congenital defect or physical injuries.The law took effect in July 2023, but it allowed covered treatments that began before then to continue until March 31.Two transgender boys and one transgender girl, all of whom were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and received gender-affirming care, challenged the ban, arguing it violates the 14th Amendment's promise of equal protection of the laws. The Justice Department also intervened.\n\n\nA federal district court blocked the law, finding it was likely unconstitutional, but a divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the decision.The Justice Department and transgender teenagers then appealed to the Supreme Court, and the justices agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge. But if Trump defeats Harris in November, the Justice Department will likely change its position in the case once he takes office. Arguments have not yet been scheduled.The dispute thrusts the justices into the culture wars, as Republican-led states have in recent months taken steps that critics argue are restricting transgender rights. In addition to the laws barring treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, states have prohibited transgender girls from playing on female sports teams. Some red states have also challenged the Biden administration's new rules\u00a0protecting transgender students from discrimination under Title IX.Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU's LGBTQ and HIV Project, told reporters during a preview of the Supreme Court's term that the challenge to Tennessee's law has a \"huge impact\" on the future of litigation on behalf of LGBTQ individuals.\"The resolution of this case is critical for access to this health care across the country,\" he said, calling the legal battle an \"inflection moment\" of whether the court will clarify that transgender people are covered by the Constitution and civil rights laws.Age-verification for pornographic websites\u00a0Although no date has been set for arguments, the case known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton involves a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the ages of their visitors.The dispute began with the enactment of Texas House Bill 1181 in June 2023, which seeks to prevent minors from accessing sexual content online. The law requires any website where one-third of their content is harmful to minors to verify that every user attempting to access that content is at least 18 years old.\n\n\nWebsites covered by the law must also display health warnings about the alleged psychological risks of pornograpy. Social media platforms and search engines are not covered by the age-verification law. Violators may face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, and if a minor accesses sexual material, the state can seek an additional $250,000 per violation.Texas is not the only state with such a law in effect \u2014 Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia all require covered websites to verify the ages of their visitors.The Free Speech Coalition, a trade group for the adult entertainment industry, as well as a group of companies that operate pornography websites, challenged the Texas law, arguing it violates the First Amendment.The challengers prevailed before a federal district court, which blocked enforcement one day before the measure was set to take effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit then upheld the law, finding that the age-verification requirement doesn't violate the First Amendment.\"The central issue in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton is whether adults' access to speech that is fully protected but disfavored by the government can be burdened in the name of protecting kids,\" said Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the ACLU, which is representing the Free Speech Coalition. \"Another way to think about it is whether adults in America will continue to have the right to freely access sexual content online.\"One issue in the dispute is the level of scrutiny the district court applied when evaluating the constitutionality of the law. The court of appeals said the proper standard was rational-basis review, the minimum level of scrutiny, and found the age-verification requirement is \"rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography.\"\u00a0But the Free Speech Coalition argues it should be subject to strict scrutiny, the highest standard of review that courts use.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has already declined a request for emergency relief, which would've blocked Texas from enforcing the law during legal proceedings.\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court's new term starts next week.

Individual freedom \u2014 what does my body, my choice really mean?\"\u00a0Melania Trump's memoir, \"Melania,\" is set to be released in the U.S. on Tuesday by Skyhorse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a Guardian report published Wednesday, the former first lady, who has been mostly absent from the campaign trail, writes in her book that \"it is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.\"\u00a0\"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,\" she writes, according to the Guardian, which obtained a copy of her book. \"Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\"\nFormer first lady Melania Trump joins Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump on stage after he officially accepted the Republican presidential nomination on the fourth day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 18, 2024 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n            \n                Andrew Harnik  / Getty Images\n\n                          \nThe revelation comes a month before the November election, and as former President Donald Trump has failed to find a consistent message on abortion rights. Vice President Kamala Harris said at the Sept. 10 debate that Trump would pass a national abortion ban, which her campaign repeated in a statement on Thursday, although earlier this week, Trump said he would veto\u00a0a national abortion ban.\n\n\n\"Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \"Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.\"Trump has insisted that states having the right to determine abortion laws is \"where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint.\"\u00a0The former president's shifting views throughout the campaign have frustrated his supporters who are pushing for a nationwide ban. His appointment of three Supreme Court justices led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and paved the way for 22 states to limit access to abortion.\u00a0The issue has become a political liability for Republicans. Polling has shown that most Americans favor abortion being legal in all or most cases.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Melania Trump writes in her book that there are \"legitimate reasons for a woman to choose to have an abortion,\" including rape or incest, the mother's life being at risk, congenital birth defects and severe medical conditions.\u00a0\"Many women opt for abortions due to personal medical concerns,\" she writes. \"These situations with significant moral implications weigh heavily on the woman and her family and deserve our empathy. Consider, for example, the complexity inherent in the decision of whether the mother should risk her own life to give birth.\"She also contends that the ability to have a late-term abortion should be protected, noting they are rare. \u00a0\"It is important to note that historically, most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child,\" she writes. \"Perhaps even the death of the mother. These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor. As a community, we should embrace these common-sense standards. Again, timing matters.\"Though Roe v. Wade allowed states to restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, or roughly 24 weeks into pregnancy, the overwhelming number of abortions happen earlier. A 2021 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of abortions in the U.S. occurred in the first trimester, before the 13th week. Fewer than 1% were performed after 21 weeks.\u00a0The former first lady said she supports some restrictions, saying she supports a requirement for minors to obtain parental consent before having an abortion.\u00a0\"I realize this may not always be possible,\" she writes. \"Our next generation must be provided with knowledge, security, safety, and solace, and the cultural stigma associated with abortion must be lifted.\"\u00a0\n\n\nSusan B.

It was then expanded in January 2023 to include migrants from Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua, whose citizens were also crossing the U.S. southern border in record numbers at the time.As of the end of August, 530,000 migrants had flown into the U.S. under the policy, known as the CHNV program, government figures show. They were granted permission to live and work in the U.S. legally for two years under an immigration law known as parole, which presidents can use to welcome foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly 117,000 Venezuelans have come to the U.S. so far under the CHNV policy, according to government data. The first group of Venezuelans who arrived through the program two years ago are set to lose their parole status later this month.Some advocates expected the Biden administration to extend the parole status of CHNV migrants, like it did for tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees and Ukrainian refugees who were also allowed into the U.S. under the parole authority.\n\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security has decided against offering Venezuelans parole extensions, or what the government calls \"re-parole,\" two U.S. officials told CBS News. The officials requested anonymity to discuss the decision before its formal announcement.\u00a0Instead, the Venezuelan parolees, as the government calls them, will be given notices instructing them to apply for another immigration benefit or leave the country, the officials said.\u00a0It's unclear how DHS will treat the cases of Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, whose parole periods will not start to expire until early next year. Former President Donald Trump has indicated he wants to end the CHNV policy, along with other Biden administration immigration programs.Venezuelans may be eligible for Temporary Protected Status if they arrived before July 2023. They can also apply for asylum, but that benefit is only available to those who can prove they are fleeing persecution based on their religion, race, political views or other grounds. Those with U.S. citizen relatives who are willing to sponsor them may be eligible for an immigrant visa.\n\n\nRepresentatives for DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The decision to refrain from offering parole extension to Venezuelans migrants could leave many of them in legal limbo, without the ability to work lawfully and no longer exempt from deportation, unless they manage to get another status. Whether any Venezuelan parolees could eventually be deported is unclear, since the government in Caracas currently rejects U.S. deportations.The move is also likely to draw significant ire from progressives and immigration advocates, who can argue the Venezuelans are being treated differently than the Afghans and Ukrainians who came to the country under similar processes.But the decision could also blunt criticism from Republicans, who have strongly denounced the CHNV policy as a fraud-ridden program that circumvents the legal immigration processes established by Congress. The policy was paused for weeks this summer as officials investigated fraud concerns relating to those applying to sponsor migrants.The CHNV policy has been a pillar of the Biden administration's strategy to deal with the unprecedented levels of migrant crossings recorded at the U.S.-Mexico border since it took office in 2021. It has paired the program, and other processes for migrants to enter the country legally, with restrictions on asylum for those crossing the southern border unlawfully.Following the enactment of partial ban on asylum claims in early June, unlawful border crossings have fallen to and remain at a four-year-low. The drop in illegal crossings by the migrants eligible for the sponsorship policy has been even more pronounced, federal data show.\u00a0\n\n\nImmigration\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. won't extend legal status for thousands of Venezuelan migrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden shores up asylum limits, likely extending border crackdown indefinitely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, allies mischaracterize data on immigrants with criminal convictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris vows to keep Biden's border crackdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden moving forward with plan to cement asylum restrictions at border\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

Johnson donated more than $1 million to Trump's first campaign, inaugural committee and a joint fundraising committee bridging the Republican National Committee and Trump's first reelection campaign.\n\n\nJett in 2016 published research that found a correlation between donations and \"the quality of diplomatic posting granted by the candidate,\" showing countries with strong economies and popular tourism destinations were often rewarded to high-end donors.But once those donors become ambassadors, they often face requests that career diplomats in lower-profile posts might not field, Jett said.\"It's probably a good thing that he sent these to an ethics person, though I don't know what the ethics person would say. It's not something that involves his official duties,\" said Jett, a critic of Johnson who noted a 2020 State Department inspector general report that alleged Johnson made \"inappropriate or insensitive comments on topics ... such as religion, sex, or color\" to employees.Johnson denied doing so, and said in response to the report, \"if I have unintentionally offended anyone in the execution of my duties, I deeply regret that.\" In January 2021, the State Department's Office of Civil Rights concluded that the allegations were unsubstantiated.A spokesperson for the Jets declined comment after CBS News sent questions for Johnson.Citing the allegations, Jett said he was \"surprised that Johnson has ethical standards high enough\" to have sought regular ethics advice.Johnson even did so when planning his own personal travels.

According to a report in the Jerusalem Post, she survived years of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of a Palestinian ISIS militant she was forced to marry, and that she was moved to Gaza several years ago.Sido returned to Iraq and was reunited with her mother and the rest of her surviving family in Sinjar, northwest Iraq, on Wednesday.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Maman, a Jewish Canadian businessman sometimes referred to as \"the Jewish Schindler\" for his efforts to help Yazidis escape ISIS captivity, posted a video on social media Thursday showing the moment the family was reunited after 10 years.\"I made a promise to Fawzia the Yazidi who was hostage of Hamas in Gaza that I would bring her back home to her mother in Sinjar,\" Maman wrote in his post on X. \"To her it seemed surreal and impossible but not to me, my only enemy was time.\"\n\n\nDavid Saranga, the director of the Digital Diplomacy Bureau at Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a separate post that Sido had \"finally been rescued by the Israeli security forces,\" without providing any details of the operation.\u00a0The Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday that the operation was led by the defense ministry's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories in collaboration with the US Embassy in Israel.The Iraqi Foreign Ministry did not mention Israeli involvement in its statement, but said Sido had been freed \"through joint efforts between the [Iraqi] Foreign Ministry and the National Intelligence Service\" in coordination with the U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Amman and with Jordanian authorities. The ministry said the process had taken four months.\u00a0Maman told the Jerusalem Post that Sido escaped from her Palestinian captor's family in late 2023 after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. She then sought refuge in a safe house within \"walking distance\" of IDF forces, but spent a month waiting for permission to leave Gaza, he told the newspaper.\n\n\nThe IDF said Sido \"was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing\" and crossed through Israel into Jordan before traveling home to Iraq.\u00a0The Free Yezidi Foundation estimates that more than 2,600 Yazidis remain missing a decade after ISIS' documented genocide against the religious minority group.\u00a0ISIS militants are believed to have kidnapped more than 6,000 Yazidi women and girls as they overran the Sinjar mountains in northern Iraq in 2014.

It was stationed in Manila as part of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, according to a news release detailing its discovery, and was damaged during combat in February 1942. A freak accident trapped it in a repair drydock on Java, an island in Indonesia, and the ship was abandoned as Japanese forces approached. It was then pressed into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy as a patrol boat. Allied pilots reported seeing the ship serve in the Japanese fleet, earning it its nickname.\u00a0\nThe USS Stewart arriving under tow in San Francisco Bay, California in early March 1946.\n\n            \n                Donald M.

The ship was towed home to San Francisco and used as a target ship in one final act of service, according to the news release.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the ship having been deliberately sunk, its location remained a mystery for decades. Now, 78 years after its sinking, the destroyer was found thanks to a collaborative effort between the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the Naval History and Heritage Command, marine technology company Ocean Infinity, and global maritime archaeology organization SEARCH. \u00a0\nThe USS Stewart sinks after its use as a target on May 24, 1946.\n\n            \n                U.S. Navy / The National Archives\n\n                          \nOcean Infinity deployed three autonomous underwater vehicles off the coast of Northern California on Aug. 1, 2024.

The guides are all from Idaho.The charges stemmed from the trio's alleged exploits between December 2021 and February 2022. They are accused of working illegally as big game outfitters and guides in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and the Bridger-Teton National Forest, U.S. Attorney Josh Hurwit said, citing the indictment. The national forests are located in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKulow, Major and Eborn were employed in Idaho by a licensed outfitter \u2014 a company that provides various services to hunters, including guiding \u2014 when they began to independently book and accept payments from hunting clients at the end of 2021, the U.S. attorney said. The three of them allegedly guided those clients through illegal hunts for mountain lions, leading to the killings of at least 11 of the animals in Idaho, and one more Wyoming. The mountain lion killed in Wyoming was a cougar recorded by the Boone and Crockett Club.The trio is also accused of falsifying portions of their big game mortality reports, which Idaho requires them to submit to the state's fish and game department, after those illegal hunts. At least three of the poached mountain lions were shipped to Texas without proper documentation, officials said, and all the animals were transported from protected land to or from Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, Texas and North Carolina. Each of those transports would violate Idaho state laws as well as federal laws under the Lacey Act.\n\n\nThe Lacey Act prohibits illegal trafficking of wildlife and plants, and regulates how both are traded or moved between states or into the country. Under the terms of the act, it is against federal law \"to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant, with some limited exceptions, taken or traded in violation of the laws of the United States, U.S. State or a foreign country,\" according to Customs and Border Protection.Amendments to the law in recent decades extended its provisions to bar trafficking of plants or animal products that were illegally harvested, as well as products without a certain kind of declaration, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service says.\u00a0Kulo and Major were arrested Sept. 24 and booked with the U.S. Marshals Service in Boise, according to Hurtwit's office. Eborn was taken into custody the following day and booked with the Marshals Service in Pocatello. Each pleaded not guilty during initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham in Idaho district court.\u00a0Their jury trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 18 in federal court in Pocatello.\n\n\nThe charges were announced the same week that an 81-year-old Montana man was sentenced to six months in federal prison for violating the Lacey Act.

They reiterated the allegations against Trump and revealed new insights into the mountains of evidence they have collected over the course of the case.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the election results far in advance of Election Day and pressured Vice President Mike Pence to reject Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021. In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol.\"When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,\" Smith and his team wrote.\n\n\nWhat the new filing says\n\n\n\n\nThe filing from Smith is divided into four parts. The first part lays out the evidence against Trump, including information that was included in the indictment against him. The second section details the legal issues surrounding presidential immunity, followed by a section that\u00a0 \"establishes that nothing the Government intends to present to the jury is protected by presidential immunity.\" The final portion details what the government is asking the court to do, namely to rule that Trump must stand trial.Names of alleged co-conspirators, campaign staff and White House officials are redacted in the filing, along with certain references to grand jury proceedings.The former president was initially charged in August 2023, and the special counsel filed a new, narrower indictment to comply with the Supreme Court's immunity decision. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.The high court laid out three categories of presidential acts and corresponding levels of immunity. Actions taken within a president's exclusive constitutional authority are entitled to absolute immunity, official acts are entitled to the presumption of immunity and unofficial acts are not entitled to immunity at all.\n\n\nSmith's brief argues that Trump's scheme to remain in power for a second term \"was a private criminal effort,\" not one that involved official conduct, and that Trump tried to overturn the election in his capacity as a candidate \u2014 not as president.\u00a0\"The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was a fundamentally private one.\"Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, criticized the release of the filing, calling it \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\"This entire case is a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes,\" he said.Smith's office declined to comment.Prosecutors offered their legal arguments in the filing for why they believe the alleged conduct was personal, not official, in nature and consistently characterized Trump's alleged actions as those of a candidate and not the president.\u00a0\"Under the Constitution, the Executive Branch has no constitutionally assigned role in the state-electoral process. To the contrary, the constitutional framework excludes the President from that process to protect against electoral abuses,\" the special counsel argued.\u00a0\n\n\nThroughout the filing, prosecutors argued Trump was not immune from criminal prosecution because he carried out the alleged conduct as a candidate for office and offered their legal basis for the inclusion of key pieces of evidence \u2014 like tweets, speeches and the testimony of White House aides \u2014 at trial.\u00a0\"He's going to declare victory\"\nPresident Donald Trump speaks on election night in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 4, 2020.\n\n            \n                MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n                          \nThe narrative begins in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election, when prosecutors said Trump was briefed on the likelihood that many Democratic voters would cast their ballots by mail and have their votes counted after Election Day. Investigators alleged Trump told his advisers that he would \"simply declare victory before all the ballots were counted and any winner was projected.\"\u00a0This plan was repeated by an unnamed political adviser, according to Smith, who wrote that the adviser told a private gathering of supporters three days before the election that Trump plans to \"just declare victory. Right? He's going to declare victory. That doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner.\"\u00a0\"Immediately following election day on November 3, the defendant did exactly that,\" prosecutors alleged, despite the fact that Trump's advisers \u2014 including Pence \u2014 \"informed him he would likely lose\" and that his claims of voter fraud \"were false.\"\u00a0Prosecutors said that while some of the former president's top campaign staff were telling him that he lost, he went on to tap his personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to spread false claims about the integrity of the election. Giuliani's name is redacted in the filing, but context makes clear whom prosecutors are referring to.The special counsel cites a conversation between two political operatives in which they discuss Trump firing his deputy campaign manager and putting Giuliani in charge.The Trump campaign's legal strategy then allegedly turned to various swing states where they sought to challenge Joe Biden's victory in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. According to prosecutors, Trump and his allies allegedly pushed false claims of fraud and tried to use those claims as a basis to appoint an alternate slate of electors that would support the unsubstantiated claims of victory. They also tried to pressure local and state officials into complying with their plans, according to prosecutors.\u00a0\n\n\n\"As late as January, the conspirators attempted to keep the full nature of the elector plan secret,\" the special counsel said. The special counsel wrote that Trump's \"steady stream of disinformation\" culminated in his speech outside the White House that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\u00a0Trump and Pence\nVice President Mike Pence presides over a joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 Electoral College results on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n            \n                Erin Schaff / Getty Images\n\n                          \nAmong the key determinations that Chutkan will make is whether Trump can face charges arising from his discussions with Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, when the electoral votes were counted.Smith wrote that the government plans to introduce evidence regarding phone calls and meetings between Trump and Pence \"in which they did not discuss Pence's official responsibilities as president of the Senate and instead acted in their private capacities as running mates.\"Trump and his allies pressured Pence to unilaterally toss out the electoral votes from key battleground states during the joint session and reverse Mr. Biden's win, prosecutors allege.\u00a0The filing states that Pence \"tried to encourage\" Trump \"as a friend\" when news networks projected Mr. Biden as the next president. In other instances, he suggested the former president recognize the \"process is over,\" and encouraged Trump to run again in 2024.\"The overall context and content of the conversations demonstrate that they were primarily frank exchanges between two candidates on a shared ticket,\" prosecutors said.The filing recounts a conversation Trump had with an unidentified aide on Jan. 6 as a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol, prompting the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers in the building. Trump had posted a message to social media criticizing Pence for refusing to toss out electoral votes. The vice president was evacuated to a secure location soon after.\n\n\nProsecutors said that after learning Pence had been forced to leave the Capitol, the aide rushed into the White House's private dining room to tell Trump \"in hopes that [he] would take action to ensure Pence's safety.\" After delivering the news, Trump looked at the aide and said, according to the filing, \"So what?\"The Capitol attack\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to supporters from the Ellipse at the White House on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n            \n                Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\n                          \nDuring his speech on Jan. 6, prosecutors alleged Trump \"told his crowd many of the same lies he had been telling for months\" and \"made clear that he expected his supporters to take action.\"\u00a0\"The defendant directed his supporters to go to the Capitol and suggested he would go with them,\" the special counsel said.As his supporters breached the Capitol, Trump monitored Twitter and Fox News, according to prosecutors, and issued messages targeting Pence. Prosecutors included many of Trump's tweets about the attack and alleged Trump \"refused\" requests from many of his advisers \"to issue a calming message and make efforts to stop the riot.\"They revealed in the filing that forensic evidence from the former president's iPhone and observations by witnesses will show that Trump \"sat in the dining room by the Oval Office, where he used his phone to review Twitter and watched television,\" which was showing coverage of the Capitol attack.An FBI forensic examiner can testify about the news and social media applications downloaded on Trump's phone, according to the filing, and can describe how it was being used throughout the afternoon of Jan. 6.Prosecutors said the activity log on Trump's phone also shows he was using it \u2014 and the Twitter app in particular \u2014 consistently throughout the day.\n\n\nAs to what was playing on the television in the dining room, Smith and his team wrote that three unidentified White House staffers can speak to what Trump was watching. Prosecutors plan to introduce \"authenticated coverage\" showing what was airing on Fox News in real time while Trump was tuned in, they said.Notably, investigators revealed Trump and his allies \u2014 including Giuliani \u2014 allegedly attempted to \"exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol\" in a bid to delay the election certification further by calling senators and leaving voicemails asking that they object to the states.Early on the morning of Jan. 7, Pence ultimately presided over the counting of the Electoral College votes, declaring Mr. Biden the winner.\u00a0Accompanying the expansive filing Smith submitted to Chutkan last week is an appendix that includes exhibits. That is being kept secret, at least for now. The judge has given Trump and his team until Oct. 10 to provide her with any objections to redactions proposed by Smith.\n\n\nTrump Investigations\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways from the major special counsel filing in Trump's 2020 election case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial counsel files key brief in Trump D.C. case, but it remains under seal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump lawyers ask appeals court to toss $489 million civil fraud ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge drops 2 counts against Trump in Georgia election probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge delays sentencing in Trump's N.Y. criminal case until after election\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \n\nMelissa Quinn\n\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

Detectives said she left the area on foot, apparently of her own free will, in a missing person flier for Strite released later that month. Strite was officially reported missing April 20.Law enforcement had asked the public for assistance as their investigation into Strite's disappearance got underway. The sheriff's office in their April bulletin had described her as 5 feet 5 inches tall and said she wore jeans and a dark blue hoodie before she disappeared. Images of Strite appeared in that bulletin alongside the description. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe owner of a property in De Soto found Strite's body on Saturday, Jefferson County Sheriff Dave Marshak announced Tuesday.\u00a0\n***UPDATE*** Through investigation, Detectives have learned Emily Strite was last seen on the morning of April 12th in...Posted by Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on\u00a0Thursday, April 25, 2024\n\nDeputies responded to a call Saturday from the De Soto property owner, who reported that human skeletal remains had been discovered in a wooded area, Marshak said. Investigators with the regional medical examiner's office determined the remains belonged to Strite, using medical and dental records to confirm the identity.\u00a0\n\n\nStrite's cause of death was still unknown as of Tuesday, according to the sheriff.

McClain said Strite was staying with a friend in De Soto at the time, and she assumed afterward that the 33-year-old had traveled over the Missouri border to Cahokia, Illinois, to visit her children at their father's home. But the father, Steve Fults, called McClain about a week later asking if she had heard from Strite, the mother recalled to Dateline.\"He has never called me and questioned anything about Emily or to tell me anything about Emily,\" McClain said, according to NBC News. \"That's why I panicked when he called me because he had never done that before.\"A missing person report for Strite was filed shortly after that.\n\n\nCBS News contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office for more information about their investigation into Strite's disappearance but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2 \"crude\" explosive devices found at Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Tampa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Iran executes 2 men in public over killing of police officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Video shows Russian jet flying close to plane off Alaska: \"Endangered all\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Princess Kate and William say young cancer patient \"inspired us both\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WWII destroyer dubbed \"Ghost Ship of the Pacific\" found off California\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Missouri\nMissing Person\n\nEmily Mae Czachor\n\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

Jack Zarifian and U.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews were both 19 years old when they died in combat in Europe, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said.\u00a0Zarifian, from Bridgeport, Connecticut, was killed while fighting with Company G, 2nd Battalion, 253rd Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division near Buchhof, Germany. Fierce fighting took place, the DPAA said in a news release, and Zarifian was reported killed in action after he was struck by a rocket on April 6, 1945. His body could not be recovered due to the fighting, and his remains were not accounted for during or after the war.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the American Graves Registration Command worked to bring home the remains of fallen soldiers, and several recovery teams went to Buchhof as part of those efforts. Several U.S. soldiers who had been buried in the town's cemetery had been exhumed shortly after the war, but Zarifian's remains weren't among them. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Lorraine American Cemetery in France.\u00a0\nU.S. Army Sgt. Jack Zarifian.\n\n            \n                Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency\n\n                          \nIt wasn't until 2023 that Zarifian's remains were found. DPAA officials received a phone call on October 18, from German officers who said they had found possible American remains near Buchhof while technicians cleared a construction site. The remains were excavated, and officials also found \"items utilized by U.S. personnel during World War II, and various personal items believed to belong to Zarifian.\" All the items were transferred into DPAA custody, and analyzed by the agency.\u00a0\n\n\nAndrews, from Gravette, Arkansas, was assigned to Company C, 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, during the war. He served during Operation Overlord in Normandy, France, helping clear German defenses, obstacles and mines from Omaha Beach and establish exit roads for invading ground troops on June 6, 1944. At some point during the invasion, he was killed, but it was unclear how because of the ferocity of the fighting, according to the DPAA.\u00a0His remains were not identified in the aftermath of the battle, but in 1946, the American Graves Registration Command began searching for missing personnel in the area. A set of remains, labelled X-48 St. Laurent, were found with a belt that had Andrews' initials on it. However, officials thought the belt could have been traded between soldiers, and other remains shared physical similarity, so an identification was not made at the time and the remains were buried at the Normandy American Cemetery as those of an unknown soldier on Dec. 11, 1948. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery.\u00a0\nU.S. Army Private Rodger D. Andrews.\n\n            \n                Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency\n\n                          \nIn December 2014, Andrews' family asked the DPAA to devote more time to his case. Historians reassessed the circumstances of his death and reexamined the belt and other clothing items he had been wearing. Once they had enough evidence to believe the X-48 remains could be those of Andrews, they exhumed them and had them transferred to the DPAA laboratory in 2019.\u00a0Both Andrews and Zarifian's remains were analyzed with a number of methods, including anthropological and dental analysis and mitochondrial DNA analysis. Circumstantial evidence was also studied in both cases.\u00a0\n\n\nZarifian's remains were accounted for on May 10, the DPAA said. Andrews' remains were accounted for on June 5. Rosettes have been placed besides both names on the Walls of the Missing where they are recorded.Both will be buried at a future date. The DPAA said Zarifian will be buried in Providence, Rhode Island, but did not specify where Andrews would be interred.\u00a0\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n U.S. bomb from WWII explodes at airport in Japan; 80 flights canceled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dozens killed in new Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Gaza Strip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WWII destroyer dubbed \"Ghost Ship of the Pacific\" found off California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bird flu kills 47 tigers, 3 lions and a panther in Vietnam zoos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Yazidi woman kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq escapes from Gaza a decade later\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          World War II\nFrance\nGermany\n\nKerry Breen\n\n\nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

But the budding photographer, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer early this year, not only got an emotional embrace from Princess Kate at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, but was lauded for inspiring Kate as she recovers from her own bout with cancer.Kate announced only weeks ago that she'd completed chemotherapy after doctors discovered cancer following an abdominal surgery in January. It was that same month that doctors told Hatton she had the extremely rare cancer desmoplastic small round cell tumor \u2014 and that she likely only had six months to three years to live. Scans revealed tumors on Hatton's ovaries and liver after she experienced abdominal pain over Christmas. Only about a dozen people are diagnosed with the aggressive form of cancer in England every year, according to cancer charity Sarcoma UK, and no standard treatment regimen exists.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, with time ticking, Hatton's mother Vicky Robayna published her daughter's photography bucket list on social media.\"We hope every day for a lifetime for her but if we can't achieve that we hope to create her a lifetime of memories,\" wrote Robayna. \"If we can make even one of her photography bucket-list happen for her she will be beyond delighted.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHatton's list included photographing a major West End musical, the catwalk runway at London Fashion Week, famous music festivals and professional models.

But, according to the Pew Research Center, the majority of Christians still feel a person's gender is determined by their sex assigned at birth.The \"CBS Mornings\" series, \"The State of Spirituality with Lisa Ling,\" explores unique paths to faith, spirituality and religion in the U.S. The latest installment of the series focuses on a Lutheran pastor in California who is trying to form an inclusive community by just being himself.Drew Stever lives in California with his partner Hazel, their three children and two dogs. He said his life is pretty average. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We play board games, and we garden and we make art,\" he said.Stever is a transgender man and an ordained minister in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).\n\n\nWhile some Christian denominations have evolved to be more inclusive of LGBTQ+ people, the acceptance of transgender clergy has been much slower. In 2015, the ELCA ordained its first transgender priest and several more followed, including Stever. Transgender clergy also serve in the Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches. But most denominations and churches still forbid it, citing the Bible verse Genesis 1:27: \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\"Stever said it is hard to relate this verse to modern times, because it wasn't written for 2024.\"It was written for then,\" he said. \"When we read in the scripture that God created, man and woman, yes. And God created everyone else as well.\"At Stever's home church, Hope Lutheran in Hollywood, congregants told us when he says \"all are welcome,\" he really means it.\n\n\n\"Pastor Drew is a good pastor and I think he focuses on Jesus' commands, we should love God and love our neighbor as ourselves,\" congregant Steven Novak said.Congregant Emma Halbert added,\u00a0\"Pastor Drew just brings such a light and life and just encapsulates everything we've always believed in in learning to really spread a message that is just love.\"Raised LutheranStever was born and raised Lutheran in Minnesota's Twin Cities. Growing up, he also went to Catholic school and attended church several days a week.\"I grew up female and in the female context and I just never felt like that worked for me,\" he said. \"I would say there was also a lot of internal turmoil.\"Throughout his childhood, Stever said he felt a lot of anger due to his gender dysphoria.\"There were definitely times where I like, if I can't exist in one way, I don't want to exist at all,\" he said. \"There were definitely periods where I thought I would just be better off not alive because I did feel a lot of pain.\"Stever credits a homeroom teacher at his Catholic school for first introducing him to a more compassionate Christian theology\u2014accepting of everyone. Armed with this new way of seeing his faith, he eventually realized he was being called to become a pastor.\n\n\nTransitioning during seminaryStever entered seminary as a woman, but did not leave that way. It was summer 2016, and leading up to the election, anti-transgender rhetoric was ramping up. But Stever said, he could no longer deny who he's always been: a man.\"There was a moment where I woke up in the morning\u2026and the words that came to my mind was 'you don't have to be angry anymore',\" he said. \"And I almost feel like God just took a snowball and just like threw it at my face.\"Stever's family and friends were supportive of his transition, but he did begin receiving hate, mostly online. He has concerns talking about his journey publicly with CBS News.\"My family's safety is probably my top priority,\" he said, adding, \"And I believe for those who need to hear, will hear.\"Feeling safe in churchStever's spouse Hazel is also a Lutheran pastor. She knows firsthand the discrimination many can face in church.\"There's a lot of people in the Christian faith who don't even believe women can be pastors,\" she said. But Hazel added that she and Stever really are, \"quite boring,\" despite what some may think.Stever hopes by being himself, he can help more people feel seen and safe in church.\n\n\n\"I would say specifically to folks of color, to people living with disabilities, people who are LGBTQ+\u2026you are good. Nothing is wrong with you. You are so good. And you don't need the church to tell you that,\" he said.Stever has a pride flag hanging outside his church, shortly after CBS News filmed there, he said someone ripped it down and damaged it. But he put the flag back up and said he is, \"not deterred by one person's small worldview.\"\n\n\nCBS Village\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to educate your kids about finances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransgender pastor fosters inclusive church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris courts Latinos with health care-focused ads slamming Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Davis on life after NFL and loss of his brother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding community without religion\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Evangelicals\nLGBTQ+\nChurch\n\nLisa Ling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Ling, an award-winning journalist and producer, is a CBS News contributor, where she brings her distinctive reporting and feature pieces across CBS News broadcasts and platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vp-candidates-word-used-most-often-debate-trump-housing-border-vance-walz/", "Title": "Words the VP candidates used most often during the debate: \"Trump,\" \"housing,\" \"border\"", "Author": "Julia Ingram", "Date": "October 2, 2024 / 7:49 PM EDT", "content": "The most frequently mentioned word by the vice presidential candidates during Tuesday's debate, excluding routine and common words, was \"Trump.\"Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said former President Donald Trump's name 66 times in a rigorous defense of his running mate's record, more than the 44 times he mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was heavier on critiques of Trump, naming him 44 times and saying Harris' name 28 times.\u00a0Walz took one of his first opportunities on a national stage to talk about his experience governing Minnesota, mentioning the state's name 26 times. Vance said \"Ohio\" five times.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take a closer look at the vice presidential candidates' rhetoric, CBS News analyzed the words they used in their only scheduled debate, and compared it to the words the presidential candidates used in the Sept. 10 debate. Here's what we found.Breaking down the words by topicLike Trump did during the presidential debate, Vance emphasized the issue of immigration, saying the word \"border\" 20 times, which was more than Trump's 12 mentions.\u00a0\n\n\nSeven times, Vance said \"millions\" of people were entering the U.S. illegally. He also echoed Trump's false claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is over 20 million. The actual number is closer to 11 million.Vance described undocumented immigrants as \"aliens\" seven times, a term Trump only used once in his debate against Harris.\u00a0Walz did not use the words \"illegal\" or \"alien\" at all, nor did Harris. Walz responded to questions on immigration by emphasizing Trump's efforts to prevent the bipartisan border bill from passing Congress, saying \"bill\" in reference to it eight times.\u00a0The vice presidential candidates mirrored their running mates' approaches when it came to language around abortion. Vance said he wanted the U.S. to be more \"pro-family\" and \"pro-baby,\" and his rhetoric reflected that. He said \"baby\" or \"family\" 10 times in the context of abortion.\n\n\nLike Harris, Walz discussed abortion in terms of women's rights, saying the word \"women\" or \"woman\" nine times. He also described abortion as \"health care\" four times, something neither Vance or Trump did.When talking about the economy, Vance focused on high prices, mentioning \"price\" 10 times and \"afford\" or \"unaffordable\" 19 times, echoing common criticisms of rising prices during the Biden-Harris administration. While inflation spiked during the first two years of Biden's presidency, it is now at its lowest point since March 2021.\u00a0Walz's rebuttals mentioned the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to negotiate drug prices, referencing prescription \"drugs\" or \"insulin\" six times. He also repeatedly emphasized job growth during the administration throughout the debate, using the word \"jobs\" seven times.The vice presidential candidates also discussed housing, more so than their running mates. Walz said \"house\" or \"home\" 28 times in the context of housing; Vance used those words 26 times.\u00a0More time was dedicated to climate change than in either of the presidential debates this year. Vance focused on \"energy,\" using the word 12 times. He also used the word \"clean\" eight times when talking about climate. Both candidates said the word \"climate\" four times, a word Trump did not mention in either of his debates this year.\u00a0How the candidates referred to each other and their running matesIn total, Walz and Vance mentioned Trump 110 times; more than double the number of times Harris and Trump said the former president's name in their debate.\u00a0Harris was mentioned by name 72 times, almost always by her full name. Vance sometimes referred to the Biden administration as the Harris administration, while President Biden only got seven mentions total from the vice presidential candidates.\u00a0\n\n\nVance also frequently addressed the moderators by name, saying \"Margaret\" 21 times and \"Norah\" eight times.When it came to addressing each other, Vance referred to Walz by his first name, Tim, 17 times, and by his full name or as \"Governor Walz\" 20 times. Walz referred to his opponent only as \"Senator Vance\" 15 times.\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Cheney campaigns with Kamala Harris for first time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelania Trump voices support for \"essential right all women possess\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVP debate ratings show how many people watched the Walz-Vance showdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWords the VP candidates used most often during the debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways from the major special counsel filing in Trump's 2020 election case\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          JD Vance\nDebate\nTim Walz\nKamala Harris\nDonald Trump\n2024 Elections\n\nJulia Ingram\n\n\nJulia Ingram is a data journalist for CBS News Confirmed.

Vance declined to answer when asked if he thought Trump lost in 2020, which Walz called a \"damning non-answer.\"Both men took aim at the candidates at the top of the ticket. Vance repeatedly criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for the current administration's policies and record, particularly on immigration and the economy.

More voters thought Walz spent most of his time explaining his views.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey is based on 1,630 interviews of likely voters who reported watching the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday, October 1, 2024. Respondents were previously interviewed between September 27-30, 2024 to indicate whether they planned to watch the debate, and if they were willing to be re-interviewed after the debate.

Liz Cheney, the highest-profile Republican to announce her support for Vice President Kamala Harris, is joining her on the campaign trail at an event at Ripon, Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party.Cheney, along with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, announced in September that Harris would have their vote. The Cheneys and Harris have practically nothing in common in their views on policy, but they a shared antipathy for former President Donald Trump and see him as a threat to democracy after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\"As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" Cheney announced last month during an event at Duke University.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheney was the third highest-ranking Republican in the House before she was ousted for voting to impeach Trump. A Trump-backed challenger then defeated Cheney in her primary. Cheney was one of two Republicans who served on the House Jan. 6 select committee that investigated the riot and what led up to it. That committee recommended that Trump be prosecuted for his conduct surrounding the assault on the Capitol.The Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon hosted meetings in 1854 that led to the creation of the Republican Party. It was designated a national historic site in 1974, and Harris is expected to address the significance of the location during her speech, according to a senior Harris campaign official.\u00a0\nFormer US Representative from Wyoming (R) Liz Cheney speaks onstage during the 2024 Martin Luther King, Jr. Beloved Community Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church on January 15, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.\u00a0\n\n            \n                Paras Griffin / Getty Images\n\n                          \nCheney's appearance with Harris is part of a concerted effort by the campaign to appeal to Republicans disaffected by Trump.\u00a0\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the campaign launched a new ad featuring a direct-to-camera appeal from a two-time Trump voter in Pennsylvania who argued the former president's economic plan will not benefit working voters.\u00a0The campaign is also hosting \"Republicans for Harris\" events across the battleground states this week, including an event with former Reps. Denver Riggleman in North Carolina and Adam Kinzinger in Las Vegas. Kinzinger also served on the House Jan. 6 committee, while Riggleman served as an adviser.\u00a0Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, noted the Cheney endorsement during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday to argue their coalition of support is wide.\"I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built, from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between there,\" Walz said. \"They don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country, and one where our politics can be better than it is.\"\u00a0\n\n\nWhile only a small number of voters who identify as conservative are backing Harris, according to a September CBS News poll, voters who identify as \"moderate\" favor Harris over Trump by double digits.\u00a0Several Republican officials spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, including Kinzinger, Georgia Lt. Gov.Geoff Duncan and Olivia Troye, a former adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence.Their activity for the campaign has continued. Troye has appeared in a Harris campaign ad, and Duncan has also been dispatched as a surrogate for the campaign in recent weeks.\u00a0After a September event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a GOP-leaning portion of the state, Duncan said Trump \"makes it harder for himself\" to not lose Republican support because of some of his criticism of Republican officials, such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.\"There's really no mystery to this. Support for Donald Trump amongst the majority of Republicans is a mile wide and an inch deep. Almost every Republican outside of a small wing of MAGA supporters would love to have somebody other than Donald Trump as their nominee, but that just didn't happen,\" Duncan told CBS News.Kate Horning, an undecided Pennsylvania voter who attended the event and backed Trump in past elections, said she likes the outreach to Republicans but wants it to be \"genuine.\"\"There's a lot of issues here. I'm not here to talk about abortion \u2014 I'm concerned about the amount of people coming across the border and how it impacts schools,\" she said.\u00a0\n\n\nSince she became the nominee, Harris has tried to appeal to centrists by supporting restrictions on immigration backed on a bipartisan level in Congress, touting herself as a pro-business capitalist and reiterating she would not ban fracking \u2014 a position she held as a 2020 presidential primary candidate but abandoned after becoming President Biden's running mate later that cycle.\u00a0\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Cheney campaigns with Kamala Harris for first time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelania Trump voices support for \"essential right all women possess\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVP debate ratings show how many people watched the Walz-Vance showdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWords the VP candidates used most often during the debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways from the major special counsel filing in Trump's 2020 election case\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Kamala Harris\nLiz Cheney\n\nAaron Navarro\n\n\nAaron Navarro is a CBS News digital reporter covering the 2024 elections.

Walz was in the U.S. and toured a Nebraska Army National Guard armory. A news radio station also reported in another Nebraska newspaper in August 1989 that Walz said he would \"leave Sunday en route to China,\" which was after the protests.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to a question about his remarks from CBS News in Middleville, Pennsylvania, Walz corrected himself and admitted he had his dates wrong, adding that he needs to be clearer when he speaks.\u00a0\"So, my clarity, to take away from the message, is something I want to be very clear \u2014 August of '89 into Hong Kong, into China,\" said the Minnesota governor, who often talks fast and in shorthand.\n\n\nWalz also clarified a verbal misstatement from the debate, when he said he was friends with school shooters. The moment was quickly seized upon by Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who posted on Truth Social about it.\u00a0Walz, a former teacher and football coach, said that although he misspoke, it is \"pretty damn clear\" that he has stood with school shooting victims and passed legislation in an effort to curb such violence.\u00a0In the same conversation at the debate on Tuesday night, Walz mentioned that his teenage son, Gus, was a witness to a shooting. On the campaign trail, Walz often says that even though he supports the Second Amendment, he doesn't think that should allow children to be shot dead in the hallways.\u00a0Walz's rally Wednesday in York, Pennsylvania, was filled with supporters who defended him.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Who can remember where they were 30 years ago?\" Joan Nagy, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania asked.\u00a0\"Anybody can make a mistake,\" Les Ford said, adding, \"When's the last time you heard Donald Trump or his running mate correct themselves?\"After rolling into the rally on the Harris-Walz campaign bus to address a crowd of around 2,000, Walz leaned in further on his debate performance.\"Anybody watch the debate last night? Not bad for a football coach, huh?,\" he quipped.\u00a0\"Now, look, there is a reason Mike Pence was not on that stage with me,\" he said. Walz added, \"I served with Mike Pence in Congress. We disagreed on most issues, but in Congress and as a vice president, I never criticized Mike Pence's ethics and commitment to this country, Walz said. \"And he made the decision for the Constitution. Mike Pence did his duty. He honored his oath, and he chose the Constitution over Donald Trump,\" Walz said.\u00a0\"Senator Vance made it clear he will always make a different choice than Mike Pence made,\" Walz said, referring to Pence's refusal to give in to pressure by Trump to not certify the 2020 presidential election. Vance has said that he wouldn't have certified the election, as Pence had, which Walz said \"should be absolutely disqualifying if you're asking to be the vice president of the United States.\"During their debate, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell noted that Vance has said he wouldn't have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors, and she asked, \"Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every governor certifies the results?\"\n\n\nVance did not directly answer, saying only, \"What President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020 and my own belief is we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Behind the scenes at the CBS VP debate stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Meet the moderators for the VP debate, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n VP debate ratings show how many people watched the Walz-Vance showdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch Tim Walz's closing statement from the 2024 VP debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Tiananmen Square\nDebate\nTim Walz\nChina\n\nShawna Mizelle\n\n\nShawna Mizelle is a 2024 campaign reporter for CBS News.\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n                  Instagram\n                \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-election-special-harris-trump-oct-7/", "Title": "Trump backs out of \"60 Minutes\" election special; Kamala Harris to be interviewed", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "Updated on:  October 1, 2024 / 9:57 PM EDT", "content": "A \"60 Minutes\" candidate hour will feature only Vice President Kamala Harris after former President Donald Trump, who'd previously agreed to be on the show, decided not to participate in the Monday, Oct. 7 special.\u00a0\"For over half a century, '60 Minutes' has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls,\" \"60 Minutes\" said in a statement. \"This year, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to sit down with 60 Minutes.

It was from Hunter, and I never got an apology, so I'm sort of waiting. I'd love to do '60 Minutes.' I do everything. I mean, I'd do you right now, right? And you're tougher than '60 Minutes,' frankly. The 'laptop from hell' was from Hunter. It wasn't from-- So I haven't gotten-- if you remember Lesley Stahl, we got into a little bit of an argument on the camera, talking about that and other things.

They should apologize. They were wrong on everything. So I'd like to get an apology. So I've asked them for an apology.\"The Republican nominee for president emphasized that he felt he was owed an apology from \"60 Minutes.\"\"Let's see if they do it. I wouldn't mind doing 60,\" Trump continued. \"I've done '60 Minutes' a lot. I did '60 Minutes' twice with Mike Wallace, the great Mike Wallace, he was great. His son is from a different ballpark. His son doesn't have-- I said, you want to be like your father?

The bulletin, authored by FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center, was first disseminated by federal law enforcement to local law enforcement partners late Wednesday.\u00a0The agencies found that the one-year mark of the attack \"as well as any further significant escalations\" in the Israel-Hamas war \"may be a motivating factor for violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to engage in violence or threaten public safety,\" the bulletin read. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulletin provided several recent examples of such threats, including the Sept. 6 arrest of a Pakistani national by Canadian authorities who was accused of planning a mass shooting at a Jewish center in New York City. The bulletin also comes as tensions have continued to ramp up in the Middle East. Following an Israeli airstrike on Beirut last week which killed longtime Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, Iran on Tuesday responded with a missile salvo on Israel, launching nearly 200 ballistic missiles, most of which were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems. Hamas and Hezbollah are both proxies of Iran.\u00a0\n\n\nIsrael also began limited ground operations in southern Lebanon this week. \u00a0Following Iran's missile attack, a senior DHS official told CBS News during a briefing Wednesday, \"I don't know that we've got a crystal clear assessment on that at this point. We are literally in the earliest days of trying to understand what exactly Iranian intentions might be. We do, though, assess that Iran has a global capacity and a global capability, that it can draw, that it can target U.S. interests around the world \u2013 that it certainly has the reach and capacity to do, to carry out, to engage with individuals here inside the United States in ways that present potential threat to the United States, here in the homeland.\" The official added that this is an area of \"near daily engagement\" between DHS, FBI and other law enforcement partners.Iran has been involved in \"a variety of other efforts in the aftermath of Oct. 7,\" the official noted, including \"putting out fabricated material to try to increase people's anger about the post-Oct. 7 situation.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe bulletin cautioned that \"the expansion of the conflict further into the region could serve as motivation for violence against Jewish, Israeli, or American targets in retaliation for civilian deaths, and we cannot preclude the possibility that threat actors in the United States will react with violence to the death\" of Nasrallah.Intelligence analysts revealed in the bulletin that the Oct. 7 attack and Israel-Hamas war \"have been cited as sociopolitical grievances influencing some individuals mobilization to violence in the United States,\" adding that \"hate crimes surged shortly following the attacks and have decreased over the past several months to levels consistent with reporting prior to the conflict, a trend that mirrors hate crimes following previous international conflicts or events.\"In the immediate months after Oct. 7, reports of antisemitic incidents surged in the U.S. The Anti-Defamation League said it recorded 2,031 antisemitic incidents nationwide between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7 of 2023, a 337% increase compared with the same period in 2022.\"Over the past year, we have observed violent extremist activity and hate crimes in the United States linked to the conflict,\" the bulletin read. \"Jewish, Muslim, or Arab institutions, including synagogues, mosques, and community centers, and large public gatherings, such as memorials, vigils, or other demonstrations, present attractive targets for violent attacks or for hoax threats by a variety of threat actors, including homegrown violent extremists, domestic violent extremists, and hate crime perpetrators who may view the anniversary as an opportunity to conduct an attack or other high-profile, illegal activity.\" The bulletin also warns that foreign terrorist organizations have created media that compares the Oct. 7 and 9/11 attacks and encourages \"lone attackers to use simple tactics like firearms, knives, Molotov cocktails, and vehicle ramming against Western targets in retaliation for deaths in Gaza. Individuals inspired by this online messaging could act alone to commit an attack with little to no warning.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As Israel plans Lebanon incursion, Hezbollah says it's ready for war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8 Israeli soldiers killed in \"intense fighting\" with Hezbollah in Lebanon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Iran launches missile attack on Israel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hamas leader in Lebanon killed in Israeli airstrike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dozens killed in new Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Gaza Strip\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Iran\nHamas\nIsrael\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security\nDomestic Terrorism\nHezbollah\nFBI\nGaza Strip\nAntisemitism\nHate Crime\n\nNicole Sganga\n\n\nNicole Sganga is a CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-ground-operations-as-hamas-war-continues/", "Title": "Israel says 8 soldiers killed in Lebanon amid \"intense fighting\" on the ground with Hezbollah", "Author": "Khaled Wassef", "Date": "Updated on:  October 2, 2024 / 8:46 PM EDT", "content": "Israel's military said Wednesday that eight soldiers had been killed in \"intense fighting\" with Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, three days after it launched ground operations in the country. The update on the ongoing ground raids came almost a year after Israel launched its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for that Iran-backed group's Oct. 7 terrorist rampage, prompting Hamas' ally Hezbollah to start firing rockets at northern Israel.The Israel Defense Forces\u00a0announced the beginning of it said would be \"limited, localized, and targeted ground raids\" against Hezbollah in Lebanon\u00a0on Monday, after about two weeks of blistering airstrikes on the group's strongholds in southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital, Beirut. Those ongoing strikes have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced about 1 million from their homes, according to Lebanese officials.The aerial assault \u2014 and unprecedented covert operations before it that saw thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies held by Hezbollah militants blown up with embedded explosives \u2014 largely decapitated the U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a strike on Sept. 27, and at least half a dozen other senior figures, and dozens of mid-level operatives, have also been killed. But even as Israel prepared to launch its ground operation, Hezbollah's surviving deputy leader declared the group ready for war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli military says it's beginning limited ground operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah\n02:09\n\nBelow is a look at how the arch enemies came to be at war again for the first time since a roughly one-month conflict in 2006 that left more than 1,000 people dead in Lebanon and more than 150 in Israel \u2014 and what's at stake this time in the wake of Hezbollah's backer Iran launching its blistering\u00a0Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, fueling fear that the U.S. could be drawn into the fighting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's happening now along the Israel-Lebanon border?The IDF confirmed Wednesday the deaths of eight soldiers in the cross-border raids, with initial statement confirming Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, 22, \"fell during combat in southern Lebanon.\" The IDF later named seven other soldiers killed in the combat.The military said the soldiers were killed in two separate incidents, and that six troops, including an officer, were severely wounded in the same incidents. The IDF did not provide further information on the nature of the deadly incidents.\nSmoke billows after an Israeli Air Force strike on a village in southern Lebanon, amid cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, as seen from Jish, northern Israel, Oct. 2, 2024.\n\n            \n                Jim Urquhart/REUTERS\n\n                          \nEarlier Wednesday, the IDF expanded its orders for people in southern Lebanon to leave their homes and evacuate north, away from the country's border with Israel, as its cross-border incursions to hunt down Hezbollah fighters and destroy their weapons and combat infrastructure appeared to intensify.\n\n\n In a message\u00a0posted on social media, IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Avichay Adraee said there was \"intense fighting going on\" in southern Lebanon, accusing Hezbollah of \"using the civilian environment and the citizens as a human shield to organize to carry out attacks.\"Adraee issued a new evacuation order to residents in 24 towns and villages across southern Lebanon, adding to the 28 villages from which he warned residents to evacuate on Monday.In its own statements on Tuesday, Hezbollah said its fighters were engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli forces in the town of Maroun al-Ras, claiming to have inflicted \"several casualties among them.\" It also claimed to have inflicted Israeli military casualties in a clash in the town of Adissah. Both towns are within about a mile of the so-called Blue Line that separates northern Israel and southern Lebanon. \n\n\n            \n                Getty/iStockphoto\n\n                          \nThe IDF has provided little information about its ground operations against Hezbollah since announcing they were underway, but it has continued bolstering its forces along the northern border, announcing Wednesday that another three brigades were being sent up to join \"the limited, localized, targeted raids on Hezbollah terror targets and terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.\"\n\n\nHezbollah has stepped up its months-long rocket attacks on northern Israel since Israel's cross-border raids began. Israeli air raid sirens blared in a number of towns near the border, and the IDF reported about 100 rockets being fired from Lebanon at northern Israel on Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of injuries.Israeli Air Force jets were also still launching strikes on southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. The air force\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that it was targeting \"munitions production sites and other terrorist infrastructures in the area.\" The Lebanese Ministry of Health said Wednesday that about 55 people were killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours alone. The Lebanese Disaster Management Unit said Israel's ongoing strikes in the country, which began almost a year ago, had killed more than 1,870 people and wounded more than 9,000 others.\nIsraeli army tanks are seen in the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, Sept. 29, 2024.\n\n            \n                MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP/Getty\n\n                          \nWhile the extent of the ongoing Israeli ground operations remained unclear, at an IDF staging area just south of the Lebanese border, it was apparent earlier in the week that Israeli forces were preparing, at least, for a significant assault.Dozens of tanks, armored fighting vehicles and bulldozers were lined up, ready for orders. On the other side of the border, tens of thousands of Hezbollah fighters \u2014 with a vast tunnel network, a reputation for guerrilla warfare and suicide bombings \u2014 were dug in, waiting to defend the territory they've controlled for decades.The last war, in 2006, ended with a cease-fire, and a United Nations peacekeeping mission of around 10,000 troops has been deployed near the border in Lebanon, along the Blue Line, ever since. That mission, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, called Israel's plans to launch ground operations in the country a \"dangerous development,\" noting that its \"peacekeepers remain in position.\"\"Peacekeeper safety and security is paramount, and all actors are reminded of their obligation to respect it. Any crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" UNIFIL said in a statement. \"We urge all actors to step back from such escalatory acts, which will only lead to more violence and more bloodshed.\"\n\n\nWhy is Israel attacking Hezbollah in Lebanon?Israeli officials have said the goal of the operations against Hezbollah is to enable roughly 60,000 people forced to flee their homes in the northern part of the country to return. They were driven away \u2014 under evacuation orders in many cases \u2014 by the hail of rocket, drone and missile fire launched by Hezbollah militants from Lebanon.\u00a0That onslaught, albeit largely ineffective thanks to Israel's advanced missile defense systems, began the day after Israel started bombing Hamas targets in Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. That massacre saw Hamas and allied terrorists kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel, and take 251 others as hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials.\u00a0\nPeople look at a house damaged by a rocket attack from Lebanon, amid cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, in Safed, northern Israel, Sept. 28, 2024.\n\n            \n                Jim Urquhart/REUTERS\n\n                          \nSince then, Israel says Hezbollah has fired more than 8,000 weapons across Lebanon's southern border. The vast majority of the projectiles are intercepted, but some do crash down, and a handful of people have been wounded in northern and central Israel by the attacks, including two men hurt by rockets that hit a bus and another vehicle on Oct. 1. The most lethal attack was a rocket that slammed into a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights in July, killing 12 young people. Hezbollah denied firing the rocket, but Israel and the U.S. blamed the group.\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to force Hezbollah back from the Lebanon border far enough to stop the barrage of rocket fire, so the displaced residents of northern towns and villages can return to their homes.\"The reality is that, prior to October 7th, there was always a vulnerability [from Hezbollah], but Israel always thought it had been tamed,\" Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the global affairs think tank Chatham House, told CBS News in September. \"What October 7th has done, I think for Israel and Israelis, is reawaken them from, you know, that mirage that they were safe and secure. So going back to October 6th without altering the balance of power on Israel's borders and within Israel seems hard to do.\"\"We all feel suffocated by the situation. We don't breathe,\" Sarit Zehavi, a researcher who worked for 15 years in Israeli military intelligence and lives in northern Israel, told CBS News before the ground operations began. \"On October 8th, basically, the war started here, with Hezbollah.\"Speaking with CBS News again on Oct. 1, Zehavi said she hoped the overall Israeli military operation against Hezbollah \"will succeed \u2014 that we will succeed in eliminating all the [Hezbollah] ground infrastructure in the area next to the border.\" But she recognized that a military assault alone was unlikely to ensure peace for northern Israel in the longer term.\n\n\n\"To tell the truth, I hope it will end with some kind of diplomatic arrangement that will enable us to breathe many more years, because they [Hezbollah] will strive to recover\u2026 After what happened on October 7th, you can no longer see Hezbollah on the other side of the border. This is the threat we cannot live with anymore.\"The U.S., Iran, and the risks of a wider warFor weeks, President Biden has called for a cease-fire as Israel and Hezbollah exchanged increasing fire over the southern Lebanon border. U.S. officials at the White House, State Department and Pentagon have all made clear the risks of an all-out war between the close American ally and Iran's most powerful proxy force in the heart of the Middle East could spiral into a broad regional conflict.Those concerns were heightened Tuesday by Iran's launch of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's vow to retaliate at the time and place of Israel's choosing.Iran backs a number of groups across the region, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Tehran refers to these groups as a \"resistance front\" against Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory, while Israel refers to it as an axis of evil with the ideological goal of wiping the country off the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFears of regional conflict intensify as Israel strikes Yemen\n02:28\n\nHezbollah calls its rocket and drone attacks on Israel a legitimate support and defense of Palestinians in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and the Houthis have claimed the same rational for their months-long targeting of commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea.One of the biggest risks, from a U.S. security perspective, is that Iran's proxy groups \u2014 including smaller militias based in Iraq and Syria \u2014 will target American forces in the region in retaliation for Washington's support of Israel. They've done so already since Oct. 7, firing rockets and drones at U.S. bases and other installations more than 165 times. Most of the attacks are inconsequential, but in January, drones fired by an Iran-backed group in Iraq  hit a U.S. outpost in Jordan, killing three U.S. troops and wounding dozens.Despite the risks and Washington's calls for deescalation, however, Israel has appeared determined to seize the momentum, with Hezbollah on a back foot in the wake of the aerial bombardment. The message has been clear: The best way to deescalate the war, from Israel's perspective, is to win it.\n\n\n\n\nSteve Berriman\n                  \n        contributed to this report. \n      \n\n\n\nIsrael & Hamas At War\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli hostage's family marks Rosh Hashanah with \"nothing to celebrate\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDozens killed in new Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Gaza Strip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's Netanyahu vows to retaliate for Iranian missile attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran launches missile attack on Israel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Israeli soldiers killed in \"intense fighting\" with Hezbollah in Lebanon\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          War\nIran\nHouthi Movement\nHamas\nIsrael\nHezbollah\nGaza Strip\nLebanon\nMiddle East\n\nTucker Reals\n\n\nTucker Reals is CBSNews.com's foreign editor, based in the CBS News London bureau.

Garfield High School has been the scene of five shootings since 2021. It's the most at any single U.S. school in the last 20 years, according to a CBS News data analysis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's something that we have to live with every day, especially being students here, and yeah, I'd say it's pretty scary, to be honest,\" Jackson Hatch said.Jackson's parents, Alicia and Michael Hatch, worry about safety when their four children are in school.\n\n\n\"You hope your kid can go to school and be safe and just focus on learning, but it does seem to be everywhere,\" Alicia Hatch said. \"It's in the schools. It's out of the schools. Crime is increasing. Gun violence is increasing and it's a scary thought.\"Last school year, two students were shot in different incidents at Garfield High School. But unless you live in the community near the school, you likely didn't hear about those shootings.\nAmarr Murphy-Paine died in one of five shootings since 2021 at Garfield High School in Seattle, the most at any single U.S. school.\n\n            \n                LaKisha Murphy\n\n                          \nA CBS News analysis of the K-12 School Shooting Database shows these \"smaller\" shootings are more frequent than mass shootings, like the Apalachee High School shooting in Georgia on Sept. 4, in which two students and two teachers were killed. Taken together, those incidents are also killing more kids than gun violence that does make national news, such as the mass shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Uvalde and now, Apalachee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly school shootings have more than tripled since 2018, and many don't make national news\n01:39\n\nIn each of the last three academic years, according to the analysis, there have been at least triple the number of school shootings compared to any single previous school year dating back to 1966.   Alicia and Michael Hatch want administrators to pay more attention to what data show are leading causes of gun violence in and around schools.\n\n\n\"We want all the children at Garfield High and throughout the public school system here in Seattle to feel safe,\" Michael Hatch said. \"I hope that we will mobilize as parents, as a community, to call upon our leaders, call upon administration to do some very, very concrete things to create safety and calm.\" Most school shootings happen outsideResearchers like David Riedman, who created the K-12 School Shooting Database, said often, school administrators don't learn lessons from past school shootings. Riedman believes they adopt policies and technological solutions, which don't address the reality of what's happening.When violence does occur, CBS News found it's more often not inside the school but outside on school grounds such as parking lots, football fields and in front of buildings. \nA CBS News investigation found gun violence is more often outside on school grounds such as parking lots, football fields and in front of buildings, not inside the building.\n\n            \n                CBS News\n\n                          \nA CBS News analysis of all school shootings nationwide revealed since 2018, 84% of deadly shootings happened outside school walls. The investigation also shows nearly 95% of deadly school shootings in the 2023-2024 school year happened outside on school campus. Last academic year, more than one-third of shootings at U.S. schools happened in parking lots, where often there is little security or attention from school administrators.   Learn from the data\"Most of the incidents were not planned attacks,\" said Riedman. \"They were fights that were escalating into shootings, domestic violence on campus, accidents, suicides, and when you look at the characteristics of those incidents, they are things that stem from conflict.\"Security consultant Michael Matranga, a former Secret Service agent, believes that's why school administrators need to understand what past school shootings can tell us about how to stop future gun violence on campus. Matranga trains and advises school districts around the country how to better prepare for incidents on their campuses.\n\n\n\"I don't think that the majority of people (school administrators) are prepared for a school shooting,\" said Matranga, who now serves as CEO of M6 Global Defense Group. \"You can't refute facts.\"The National Council of School Safety Directors, which Matranga vice-chairs, urges all schools to hire a trained, experienced professional whose only job is to oversee security at the district level. CBS News found out of thousands of school districts across the nation, less than 200 have a full-time district safety director.\"We have to stay on top of what the threats are,\" Jason Stoddard, chair of the National Council of School Safety Directors and district safety director at Charles County Public Schools in Maryland, said. \"We have to be flexible enough and be knowledgeable enough to make sure that we're anticipating what's going to happen.\"Stoddard said too many schools spend money on \"solutions\" to school gun violence that have not been proven by the data to work. Experts explained items like special door locks on classrooms and rolling bulletproof blackboards don't address the majority of the gun violence on school grounds across the country. \"When we start parsing through the data, we have to look at all the variables and come up with any solutions from that information,\" Stoddard said.He showed CBS News some solutions he's implemented in Maryland. He said many of the items cost little to no money, but most schools around the country haven't implemented them yet. \u00a0Examples include:Staff patrolling parking lotsMandatory ID's worn by everyone (students, staff and visitors) all the timeDoors locked to the outsideRoom lettering or numbering on paper placed in windows so emergency responders can see from outside the schoolRadios on which administrators can talk immediately with local police, not just among themselvesCamera systems that allow security professions to see all of the campus, not just hallways and classrooms\nIn Charles County Public Schools in Maryland, camera systems are used to surveil all of the grounds, not only inside the buildings.\u00a0\n\n            \n                CBS News\n\n                          \n\"There's no one-size-fits-all solution,\" Stoddard said. \"We know that if we concentrate on those fundamentals of school safety, that we reduce the risk.\"\n\n\n\"This community has had enough\"Seattle Public Schools administration is focusing on what it can do to reduce the risk at its schools, including Garfield High School. Superintendent Dr. Brent Jones held a press conference with safety advocates, community groups and stakeholders before the current school year began.\"I believe that this community has had enough,\" Jones said. \"Our schools are safer now internally than they are externally.\"CBS News pressed for details about how the new plans address the shootings outside school buildings.\"We need cameras,\" Jones said. \"We need police presence, but we also need to balance that with counselors and social workers and care coordinators and community violence interrupters. \u00a0Student develops his own safety app for schoolsJackson Hatch didn't wait on school administrators. The rising senior at Garfield High developed his own push alert app for iPhones and Android devices. The app is designed to prevent what happened to him when he drove up on the active shooting scene with no warning as he returned to school from lunch. The app will alert students, teachers and parents about emergencies on campus. Jackson even raised money through a GoFundMe account to pay for any costs associated with the app, so it will be free to anyone who wants to use it. Garfield High School's principal has agreed to work with Jackson to distribute the app. A Seattle Public Schools spokeswoman told CBS News a district representative plans to meet with Jackson, as well.Jackson hopes to share the app with schools nationwide.\n\n\n\"The whole idea is that everyone has access to the information immediately,\" Jackson Hatch said. \"It's going to have a feature with a map and identify hotspots and be a great source for data.\"Jackson's parents said they're frustrated it takes a student to come up with solutions because school leaders don't seem to be able to respond effectively and efficiently, and the same type of shootings seem to keep happening around the country.\"I think that we should be doing more,\" Michael Hatch said. \"This is a moment for everybody to lean in and not lean out and not point fingers, but everybody needs to do more and do better. What is it going to take until we find a solution, until there's a breaking point, until we address this?\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How replica guns are getting Americans killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Video of judge being shot to death shown at court hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At least 23 confirmed dead in school bus fire in Thailand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Missouri woman found dead 5 months after mysteriously vanishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          School Shootings\nGun Violence\nSchool Shooting\n\nLaura Geller\n\n\nLaura Geller is a multi-award-winning investigative journalist.

Many have roughly the same weight, markings and finishes as real guns. But these look-alike replica guns aren't federally required to have any clear indicators that they don't shoot bullets. In most states they are available for adults to purchase without background checks or restrictions.\u00a0Despite not being classified as lethal weapons, having one has gotten people killed.Just this year, 12 people have been shot and killed by police while in possession of a replica gun. Three of them were under the age of 18. Since 2014, at least 320 people have been shot and killed by police while holding replica guns, according to a\u00a0Washington Post database and CBS News review of incidents. Nineteen of those victims were minors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more of these guns get into peoples' hands each year, police, lawmakers and activists are struggling to find ways to keep them safe.\"Almost identical to the real deal\"In the U.S., most toy guns are required to have either a brightly colored tip or colors along the body to distinguish them from real guns \u2014 like the neon colors on Nerf water guns or the orange nub on the muzzle of a toy pistol. Since 1989, it's\u00a0been illegal to \"ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without those markings.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns\" aren't held to that same standard.\u00a0 Due to a loophole in federal law, these types of compressed air guns, shooting small projectiles made of metal, are allowed to look completely realistic without any differentiating marks. Regulators and lawmakers have been saying for years these rules need to change, but the law hasn't been updated since it was created.Some manufacturers, like German-based Umarex USA, have taken full advantage of this loophole. The company's website identifies it as \"the world's largest manufacturer of over-the-counter-firearm replicas\" and lists partnerships with well-known gun companies like Beretta, Colt and Glock. Consumer reviews online rave about how realistic these replicas are. One May 2024 Amazon review for Umarex's Glock 17 Blowback \u2014 currently available for as little as $79.99\u00a0\u2014 reads \"Pistol functions well and is almost identical to the real deal.\" Though the packaging does include a warning that the gun \"may confuse people. \u2026 Police and others may think it is a firearm,\" it has no obvious markings on the actual gun showing it's not a lethal firearm.\"Even in your hand it feels very real,\" Jim Balthazar, a retired special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS News. \"It's not like it's plastic where you can pick it up and it's very light. It's solid and \u2014 it kind of has the comparable weight to a real firearm.\"CBS News met Balthazar at a shooting range where he examined both the Umarex Glock airgun and a real Glock pistol.\n\n\n\"I think it would be superhuman to be able to tell the difference in the midst of an interaction with a suspect, certainly on the street, lighting conditions are not good and so forth \u2026 it looks too real.\"That similarity has sometimes proved to be fatal.Shot for carrying a replicaIn 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers may use deadly force when they reasonably believe \"the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or another person.\" That means if police can't tell whether a gun is a lethal powder gun or a non-lethal BB or pellet gun, they're legally allowed to use deadly force.\"It presents a dilemma for law enforcement officers because it looks so real that officers are going to have to react as if it's a real gun,\" Balthazar said. \"If it's very close, it's not something they're gonna bet their life on and hope that it's a toy.\"Already this year that's proven to be true.On April 26, 17-year-old\u00a0Brandon Salgado was killed by police in Long Beach, California while he was allegedly committing a home robbery. He was armed with a replica gun.On May 1, 14-year-old\u00a0Damian Scott Cadena Haglun brought what looked like a long gun to his middle school in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin and was killed by police outside the building. It was a pellet rifle.\n\n\nOn June 28,\u00a013-year-old Nyah Mway was stopped by police in Utica, New York because they said he fit the description of a robbery suspect. Police said the boy tried to run away and pulled what looked like a handgun out of his pocket. He was shot and killed by police. He had a Umarex Glock BB gun.In September, Mway's family filed a notice preserving their right to bring a lawsuit against the involved police officers and the city of Utica. The officers involved are on paid administrative leave according to the police department and are under investigation by the state attorney general.They're three of the 19 minors who have been killed by police since 2014 while holding replica guns.Utica Police Chief Mark Williams says he holds the manufacturers partially responsible for Mway's death.\"These guns should not be made and manufactured to the exact replica of a real handgun,\" Williams told CBS News. \"They gotta know that eventually these weapons are going to fall in the hands of young kids.\"Lindsay Nichols, policy director of the Giffords Law Center, agrees that the fault lies in part with manufacturers choosing to make and market look-alike pellet guns, and believes the public needs to be able to hold them accountable.\"They know that these guns can be mistaken for real guns. In fact, it's an industry standard these days for them to be sold with warnings that say that brandishing this gun can be dangerous because if it's brandished in public it can be mistaken for a real gun,\" Nichols said. \"They supply those warnings when they sell these guns. So the industry knows these can be dangerous in this particular way.\"\n\n\nCBS News asked firearm manufacturers including Glock why they partner with pellet and BB gun manufacturers, and how much money they make off licensing those look-alikes. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Manufacturers targeting kidsIn the absence of strong federal laws around BB and pellet guns, states have stepped in to try to implement regulations. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently regulate the sale and possession of non-powder guns. Thirteen states \u2013 including New York, Wisconsin and California, where the three minors were killed by police this year \u2013 have laws against underage children buying or possessing pellet or BB guns without parental supervision.But even though states are trying to keep realistic replica guns out of kids' hands, there's evidence that manufacturers have been marketing directly to them for years. A 2012 publication from the National Shooting Sports Foundation stated, \"Youth ambassadors and others should focus on getting newcomers to take a first step into target shooting through any means, whether a BB or pellet gun, paintball gun, or archery bow. The point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms.\"CBS News asked the NSSF for a comment on the recent shootings by police who mistake pellet and BB guns for the real thing. The response: \"We represent firearm manufacturers. BB/pellet guns are not firearms and are not regulated as such. While we do not represent that industry, it is important to note that BB/pellet guns are also not toys and can cause serious physical injury if not used in a responsible manner.\"\"They get teenagers interested in BB guns, and that interest grows into an interest and a desire to purchase real guns. This is part of the gun industry's marketing strategy,\" Nichols said. \"They know that they need new consumers for their profits, and they know that these guns look like real guns \u2026 People will move up to the real guns.\"A patchwork of regulationsSome states have also moved to block the online sale of BB and pellet guns.CBS News tested how effective these restrictions on online purchases of BB guns are by attempting to buy the Umarex Glock 17 from multiple online marketplaces, including Amazon, Ebay and Facebook Marketplace. On each site, reporters used the addresses of police stations in major cities to determine whether the purchase would be possible.\n\n\nThe team was able to place orders to 41 states on Amazon. When using ZIP codes from restricted jurisdictions, the site wouldn't allow the gun to be placed in the online shopping cart and a notification popped up alerting users the purchase was not allowed in that state.Ebay permitted shipping to two additional states \u2013 California and Massachusetts. A pop-up notice during check out on all orders reads \"item is regulated by Part 121 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\" In a statement to CBS News, eBay said: \"eBay policies lay out strict guidelines for the sale of BB guns, airsoft, and air rifles or air pistols, including a disclaimer prohibiting shipping of these items to jurisdictions where they are restricted. Users found violating these policies may face consequences up to, and including, a permanent suspension.\"Facebook Marketplace, where users can sell goods directly to buyers,\u00a0has its own regulations banning the purchase or sale of all \"Paintball, airsoft, and BB guns, and their parts and projectiles.\" Yet CBS News found numerous listings that appeared to violate that policy, making these guns easily accessible either by pickup or delivery. After CBS News notified Meta of the listings, they were removed, though CBS News continued to find new listings. A spokesperson said that 98.4% of problem listings are caught by its systems before being flagged by users.As with real firearms, though, once a BB gun is purchased it's relatively easy to transport across state lines, regardless of local laws.\u00a0Attempts at reforms falterFor decades, some lawmakers have been trying to expand these restrictions, hoping to make these BB and pellet guns harder to access and harder to mistake for the real thing.Democratic New York Rep. Edolphus Towns introduced federal legislation seven times between 1995 and 2007 that would ban or limit the manufacture and sale of toy handguns that had the shape and size of real firearms. None of his bills made it out of committee.In 2014,\u00a0California lawmakers pushed legislation requiring all pellet and BB guns sold in the state to be made out of translucent materials, or have entirely neon colored bodies. The National Rifle Association fought back, claiming that because some real guns are now made with colorful materials, police would confuse the real colorful guns with the colorful BB and pellet guns. Other gun advocates said the colors would lead consumers to wrongly believe pellet and BB guns are toys and therefore safe. The measure failed.\n\n\nBack in 1994, the chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the group that now oversees the sale and production of BB and pellet guns on a federal level, said she wanted further safeguards for kids. That year, several toy stores announced they would no longer be selling realistic toy guns.\u00a0In her statement on the move, Chair Ann Brown wrote, \"Fatal accidents with guns involving kids are tragic. Real-looking toy guns may be a small part of the problem of violence in our society, but it is the part of the problem we can solve. Today, I challenge the toy industry to stop producing any guns that look like or could be modified to look like real guns. This would be a meaningful contribution to the safety of American children.\"Twenty-five years later, still no changes regarding pellet and BB guns had been made to the code. Then in 2019, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal\u00a0sent a letter to the acting chairman of the CPSC demanding \"the CPSC issue regulations to ensure that non-powder guns, including traditional BB guns, look markedly different from real firearms, and imitation and toy guns.\" The senators went on to point out that even when these guns do have colorful tips and tags, they are easily tampered with. They requested the CPSC find new, more tamper-proof ways to differentiate these toy and non-powder guns.The CPSC told CBS News there is \"no planned work to update the regulations,\" and industry groups estimate that the yearly sales of pellet and BB guns will double by 2030.\"It's completely unacceptable. \u2026 All the people that die in this fashion don't need to die,\" Nichols said. \"It's completely preventable if there are simply safety standards and if the industry can be held accountable in court.\"\n\n\nEye On America\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow replica guns are getting Americans killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome hospice care in the spotlight as Jimmy Carter turns 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow CBS News tracked down romance scammers preying on Americans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the \"hustle kingdom,\" where overseas scammers prey on Americans online\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Guns\n\nCait Bladt\n\n\nCait Bladt is a writer and producer with the CBS News Confirmed team based in New York.\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghana-romance-scammers-duping-americans/", "Title": "How CBS News tracked down Ghanaian romance scammers duping Americans into parting with huge sums of money", "Author": "Meshack Dube", "Date": "Updated on:  September 27, 2024 / 4:08 AM EDT", "content": "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Nigerian Prince\" emails became infamous \u2014 typically involving someone claiming to be royalty and asking for money that they promised would be paid back with a hefty commission added once the purported royal offspring came into his inheritance.\u00a0Most people know by now that these outlandish claims are a scam. But as internet connectivity became cheaper and more accessible on the African continent, those scams have morphed into something far more sophisticated, and much harder to recognize.I have traveled with a CBS News team to Ghana fairly often, and every time we've visited, we'd hear about so-called romance scams. For more than a year, CBS News has been investigating the devastating toll that overseas-based scams are taking on Americans of all ages and background. The amount of money flowing from American victims to fraud syndicates has topped $10 billion, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And that number, experts say, is almost certainly an undercount.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver that period, CBS News has tried to understand what \u2014 and who \u2014 is driving the criminal activity, but scammers have been unwilling to talk. Why would any fraudster willingly share the tricks of their trade, after all? \u00a0And make no mistake \u2014 while many young Ghanaians are lured into potentially lucrative lives of cyber fraud, they quickly become tools of transnational criminal syndicates that work in what's become a billion-dollar industry.\u00a0 But earlier this year, the CBS News team began to peel back the veil of secrecy on one of the criminal enterprises targeting unsuspecting Americans in the perceived safety of their own homes.\n\n\nGhana's underground \"boiler rooms\"A CBS News photographer went undercover to film inside a so-called \"boiler room\" in a dusty part of Ghana's capital Accra, where young men work for a syndicate boss who provides them with laptops, phones, internet and stable electricity. They work late into the night, trawling online dating sites for lonely, older victims they cynically refer to as \"clients.\"\u00a0Eventually we convinced a junior member of one of the operations to talk to us on the condition we hid his identity. He claimed he didn't do it much anymore, although the evidence we saw suggested it was pretty much his full-time job.In order to persuade him to speak to us, we agreed to conceal his identity, referring to him only as Abdullah. He has a wife and kids who know nothing about his double life. His boss gets 60% of the cut and Abdullah takes home the remaining 40%. \u00a0He told us he mainly targets American men, as they're easier to trick. Women, he said, take a lot longer to fall in love.\u00a0\n\n\nHe poses as a beautiful woman living in the U.S. His victims on the other end of the dating apps, on the other side of the world, have no idea they're actually talking to a young man in Ghana.\u00a0\"I pretended to be a girl,\" Abdullah said. He builds trust by sending \"flowers and chocolate\" after convincing his victims to provide an address.\"If you chat like you are in Ghana, they know that Ghana and Nigeria (have) plenty of scams,\" Abdullah said, explaining that his work requires a fair amount of time spent researching his purported home state: \"You have to study, you have to know a lot about it. If you're, like, in California, we have to set our time and everything\u2026 California time.\" \u00a0 \u00a0Abdullah and those like him in the boiler rooms are fairly low down in the criminal hierarchy. Most syndicates have \"closers\" who step in once a victim is on the hook.The closersThe closers are often well-educated young men who speak English well. At first they were skittish and reluctant to talk.\u00a0But we got the sense they were proud of their work, and wanted to show it off.\u00a0The two men who finally agreed to speak to CBS News \u2014 a syndicate boss who called himself Voodu and senior operator who went by Cola (not their real names) \u2014 said they only agreed to talk because their \"motives are misunderstood.\"\u00a0 And once they started talking, they couldn't stop. (Although they were accompanied by\u00a0 an \"enforcer\" who glared at us throughout the interview and threatened that his, \"boys will hunt you down,\" if we revealed their identities.)\n\n\nVoodu said he has been in the game for nearly 15 years, and he claims to employ around 50 people.\u00a0\"I'm the mastermind behind the whole thing,\" boasted the smooth-talking operator, oozing confidence. He even tried to charm us, styling himself as some kind of Robin Hood.\"Where I come from, it's very hard. It's very difficult for people to get money,\" he told us. \"So I came up with this whole idea just to support my neighbors, those who do not have it, the poor, the needy, the orphanage\u2026 just help everybody out.\"We have no idea if Voodu has actually tried to help his community, but he's certainly living the good life. He claimed he would leave the world of crime once he's made enough money to start his own business.He acknowledged that his work in the meantime does harm many other people, and said, \"sometimes, I feel bad.\"\u00a0But not bad enough to stop doing it.Cola said he's a university graduate who didn't have enough money to pay his school fees, and then after he'd qualified as a teacher, couldn't find a job. We asked him how he felt about making a living by stealing money from others.\n\n\n\"It has both sides. It's a mixed feeling,\" he said. \"Sometimes I feel disappointed, like I didn't go to school to do this. I can do better than this. \u2026 Sometimes when I take money from people and feel like, 'Oh my God, these people, how are they going to feel?' l imagine that it is my dad. But you know, there's no sympathy, because once you go on the sympathetic side, you go hungry.\"\nDebora Patta speaks with members of the Ghanaian syndicate, including leader \"Voodu\" (3rd from left) and senior operator \"Cola\" (right).\n\n            \n                CBS News\n\n                          \n\"If you have the conscience, you can't\u00a0 proceed, you can't push. Because sometimes I need to push people to the limit to get something from them,\" he said, adding that for many young men in his position, \"if this game had not come, they'd have to pull the trigger on people and steal from them.\"The big conThey may not be putting a gun to people's heads, but their criminal actions are still devastating for victims left broken-hearted and financially ruined.\"I fish everywhere in the world,\" Voodu told us, but he said the easiest victims to catch, \"they are Americans.\"He said his team in the boiler room begins by sending a victim little tokens of affection; chocolates, a teddy bear, even ordering their favorite food online and having it delivered to their doorstep. They shower them with attention, messaging them constantly and making them feel loved, adored and special.\"I will make you fall in love with me,\" he boasted. \"If you don't hear from me within a second, you know, you wouldn't be happy, you'd be worried.\"When a victim insists on a video call, Voodu said he hires online porn actors and records them acting out scenarios he directs \u2014 from the mundane to the more raunchy. \u00a0\n\n\n\"They think they're talking to this beautiful blonde woman (that) I have paid to just have her on video call,\" he tells us.\u00a0 If a victim gets suspicious, Voodu is ready. He showed CBS News how he uses an image of one of his recruited porn actors to forge an image of an American passport as proof of identity. \u00a0If the victim demands an in-person visit, they arrange for a meetup with a woman who gets a cut of the profits.Building trust can take months.\u00a0\"We do all that to get his attention and trust,\" he explained. \"Then, boom \u2014 we chip in business.\"Then it's time for the big con: Getting their victim to part with huge sums of money.\u00a0The set-up often centers around Ghana's globally renowned goldmines, the largest in Africa. The scammer, still posing as the woman the victim has come to trust, will claim to be in line to inherit one of these mines. The victim is invited to invest in the mine with the promise of huge returns that will ensure a wonderful future for the happy couple.\u00a0They show forged ownership documents, complete with official looking seals.\n\n\nThe pair claimed to CBS News that their biggest payout was in the millions.One victim's storyGerald Kpangkpari heads up the anti-money-laundering unit in Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime Office.\"We have a lot of unemployed youths, people who are talented, who have gone to school, and they don't have anything to do,\" he explained. He described their main targets: \"Male. Caucasian male. \u2026 They are elderly people who are quite lonely.\u00a0The Ghanaian scammers we have spoken with told us they prefer targeting men as they're easier to trap and less likely to report it, because of their shame over being conned.Among the victims is a 75-year-old American radiologist who we're identifying only as John. He declined to give an interview for precisely that reason \u2014 he's ashamed of having fallen into the trap.John's daughter went to FBI agents, who handed the file over to Ghana's organized crime unit.Kpangkpari told us that John believed he was in love with an Australian woman named Grace Erskine who lived in the U.S. He was actually talking to 34-year-old syndicate boss Alfred Kwame Ayivor, posing as Grace.\n\n\nAyivor controlled the entire scam, which included the extreme measure of hiring a woman to play the part of Grace for any in-person meetings John insisted on. Below is part of a text message exchange between Ayivor and the woman he hired:Woman: What's my cut?Ayivor: How about $100,000?Woman: $250 000. Without me, everyone gets nothing. I could always call him [John] and say it was a scam.\u00a0She clearly did not follow up on the threat. Pretending to be Grace, she visited John in the U.S., even meeting his family, Kpangkpari told us.\u00a0She claimed she'd inherited a Ghanaian gold mine, which John was offered a stake in to secure their future together. To seal the deal, the couple were to meet again, in Ghana's capital city, as organized by Ayivor:\u00a0Ayivor: That's where we stand with John, one week in Ghana with Grace.Woman: Yuck. He's so gross.Ayivor: One week + TLCWoman: I am not opening my legs for him.\u00a0John did travel to Ghana and stayed for some of the time at the same hotel as Grace in Accra. Ayivor posed as their driver the entire time, apparently to keep an eye on an operation he hoped would yield a big payday.By the time the fraudulent romance was over, Kpangkpari said John had shelled out more than $700,000 on what turned out to be a non-existent investment in a non-existent gold mine.\u00a0\nAyivor and \"John\" are seen together during John's visit to Accra, Ghana.\nKpangkpari said the \"exchange of information\" between his team and U.S. law enforcement agencies is always crucial, but it was the sheer quantity of money flowing into Ayivor's account that raised a red flag for the Ghanaian detectives, as Ayivor was officially unemployed at the time.\u00a0\"We realized that the person did not have any form of work that is commensurate with the amount of moneys that were coming into his account,\"\u00a0 Kpangkpari told CBS News.\u00a0\n\n\nAyivor was arrested in 2019 and his assets were seized, but he died of an unknown illness before facing trial. Kpangkpari's unit has been able to return a little over $36,000 to John, and they're still trying to recover more of the money the American sent to Ghana.As for the mysterious blonde woman who posed as Grace \u2014 she had vanished after her contacts with John. The Ghanaian authorities identified her as an Australian national named Rebecca Jade Silk.\u00a0The CBS News team tracked her down in September outside Sydney, Australia. When confronted, she kept her mouth shut and her head down, refusing to confirm or deny the allegations. Silk has not been charged with any crimes. She remains a person of interest for the Ghanaian authorities.\nRebecca Jade Silk is seen at the home of \"John\" in the United States, where she portrayed herself as \"Grace\" during a one-week visit in 2019, in a photo provided to CBS News by Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime agency.\u00a0\nNo turning back from the life of blingThe \"Yahoo boys\" of the boiler rooms and their so-called hustle kingdoms have been glamorized in popular West African culture, perhaps unsurprising given the millions they claim to be raking in.When asked if their victims go into debt because of what they do, Voodu laughed and said, \"yeah.\"They live a flashy lifestyle \u2014 complete with expensive clubs, beach parties and fancy cars. We filmed one group celebrating a big payout by just throwing money in the air.Given that they lie and cheat for a living, I put it to the group bluntly: How I could be sure they weren't lying to us in the interview?\n\n\nCola responded with annoyance: \"I don't lie and cheat for a living. I'm using what I have here [pointing to his head] to survive. I decided to be honest to you.\"In a country where poverty is rife and jobs are scarce, there's a long line of kids ripe for recruitment into a life of crime.

After all, the cost of living has risen dramatically over the last couple of years, driven by higher housing prices, increased grocery bills and rising expenses for basic necessities like utilities and transportation. For many, these higher costs are eating into their budgets, leaving little room for unexpected expenses or emergencies. And, in some cases, the financial strain has forced people to rely on their credit cards to make ends meet, leading to an increase in consumer debt nationwide.As a result, credit card debt is climbing. During the second quarter of this year, the total amount of credit card debt nationwide surpassed $1.14 trillion for the first time in history, and millions of Americans are now carrying high-rate card balances. There has also been an uptick in the number of cardholders who are struggling to stay on top of their monthly credit card payments, which can quickly become a heavy burden, especially considering how fast the late fees and interest charges compound.\u00a0If you're one of the many cardholders who's struggling to manage their credit card debt, you may be considering your debt relief options. One option that could help substantially ease the burden is credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, which can reduce your outstanding debt by 30% to 50% on average. But how can you qualify for credit card debt forgiveness if you need the extra help this October? That's what we'll explain below.Is your credit card debt compounding? Find out how to eliminate it now.How to qualify for credit card debt forgiveness this OctoberThere are no strict, formal qualifications for credit card debt forgiveness. However, it's important to understand what the process typically entails and the conditions that can improve your chances of success.\u00a0\n\n\nCredit card debt forgiveness involves negotiating with your creditors to settle your debt for less than the full amount owed. This can be done on your own, but most people choose to work with a professional debt relief company, which can handle negotiations on your behalf and offer guidance throughout the process.If you plan to work with a debt relief company, there are some common requirements to be aware of. One is that most debt relief companies have a minimum debt threshold you'll need to meet before they will take you on as a debt forgiveness client.\u00a0This minimum is typically around $7,500 in unsecured debt, though it can vary from one company to the next. That minimum debt threshold ensures that you have enough debt to make the settlement process worthwhile for both you and the company handling your negotiations. If your total debt is less than this, you may not qualify.Debt forgiveness programs are also generally designed to help cardholders who are experiencing significant financial hardship. This can include losing a job, dealing with unexpected medical expenses or facing other financial challenges that make it difficult to pay off your credit card debt.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen you enter into debt settlement negotiations, creditors are more likely to agree to settle for less if you can demonstrate that you're unable to pay the full amount. This means that to qualify, you may need to provide evidence of your financial hardship, such as income statements, medical bills or documentation of other debts.It's also important to note that debt settlement is typically reserved for cardholders who are behind on their credit card payments. Creditors are less likely to agree to settle for less if you've been consistently making minimum payments, as this shows that you're able to manage your debt, albeit slowly. If you've missed payments or are at risk of defaulting on your credit card, you'll be in a better position to negotiate a settlement.\u00a0Learn more about debt forgiveness today.What to do if you don't qualify for credit card debt forgivenessIf you find that you don't meet the criteria for a formal debt forgiveness program, or if you prefer to explore other options, consider the following alternatives:DIY debt settlement: If you don't qualify through a debt relief company, you can attempt to negotiate settlements directly with your creditors. While the negotiations can be challenging, it allows you to avoid the requirements and the fees associated with debt relief companies.Debt consolidation: If your credit score is still relatively good, you may qualify for a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer credit card with a low introductory interest rate.Credit counseling: Credit counseling agencies can provide budgeting advice and may be able to help you enroll in a debt management plan to lower interest rates and consolidate payments.Bankruptcy: While a last resort, bankruptcy can provide a fresh financial start for those with overwhelming debt.\u00a0The bottom lineCredit card debt forgiveness can be a lifeline for those facing overwhelming debt, but it's important to understand how to qualify before pursuing this option. If you're dealing with a significant amount of credit card debt and financial hardship this October, consider exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution. But even if you don't qualify, there are other paths to managing your debt, including debt management plans, consolidation loans and bankruptcy as a last resort. By taking proactive steps and seeking out the right debt relief option for your situation, you can start to regain control of your financial future.\n\n\nAngelica Leicht\n\n\nAngelica Leicht is senior editor for Managing Your Money, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

From high-yield savings accounts to certificates of deposits (CDs) to money market accounts and even high-yield checking options, there were multiple ways to earn a substantial return on your money with little risk.But the interest rate climate is changing again.The Federal Reserve, prompted by a drop in inflation, cut its federal funds rate for the first time in more than four years in September. Additional cuts now appear likely for November and December, too. And while this will be a boost for borrowers saddled with higher interest rates, it could cause the benefits of the aforementioned savings vehicles to quickly decline. Understanding this dynamic, then, savers may want to act aggressively. One way to do so is by putting $5,000 into a long-term CD this October, while it's still advantageous. Below, we'll detail three reasons why you should strongly consider this move now.See how much more you could be earning on your money with a top CD here now.Why you should put $5,000 into a long-term CD this OctoberNot sure if it makes sense to open a $5,000 CD this month? Here are three reasons why it could be the right decision for your money.\n\n\nInterest rates on long-term CDs are still highInterest rates on CDs haven't dramatically changed from where they were a few months earlier, despite the rate trends. But that doesn't mean they'll remain this high for much longer, either. So act while the opportunity is still available. You can open an 18-month CD with a rate of 4.40% right now. 2-year CDs, 3-year CDs and 5-year CDs all have comparable rates, too, if slightly lower.\u00a0But if rate cuts are issued in the months to come \u2014 or economic data is released that shows rate cuts to be more likely \u2014 returns on these accounts could decline in advance, even before a formal Fed action takes place. So don't wait for that to happen.Get started with a top CD here now.You'll earn a high return even as rates fallHigh-yield savings accounts have rates comparable to CDs right now, as do some other accounts. However, the alternatives often have variable interest rates, which can and will decline as the overall rate climate does. CD rates, on the other hand, are fixed, allowing savers to earn the high rate they lock the account with today for the full term of the account.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a long-term CD, that could be anywhere between 18 months and 10 years. That said, you should only deposit an amount that you can easily afford to leave in the account for the full term or you'll risk having to pay an early withdrawal penalty to reopen the account.\u00a0You can earn hundreds of dollars or moreSometimes it's easier to determine the true value of a financial product by calculating the exact return you stand to make. And that's easy to do with a CD since the rate is fixed. If you open a 2-year CD with a rate of 4.20%, for example, you'll earn approximately $483 on your $5,000 deposit. If you keep the money in longer, you'll make even more. A $5,000 5-year CD at 4.35% will leave you with a profit of around $1,187. Calculate the numbers in advance and shop around for lenders online to determine exactly how much you could make by acting now.The bottom lineSure, interest rates looking to be heading downward, but they haven't yet dropped enough to offset the benefits of a long-term CD. By acting now, savers can still lock in a high rate and they'll keep it long-term, even as the overall rate climate declines. They'll also potentially earn hundreds of dollars (if not more) with a $5,000 deposit into the right account. But the the timing here is critical to get right. As interest rates are cut, and likely before then, lenders will start reducing their offers on accounts like these. So it behooves savers to act before that happens.\n\n\nMatt Richardson\n\n\nMatt Richardson is the managing editor for the Managing Your Money section for CBSNews.com.

With inflation remaining high throughout much of 2022 and 2023, investors scrambled to find safe havens for their money, with many turning to gold for its inflation-hedging properties. That, coupled with concerns over the high-rate environment and the ongoing geopolitical tensions, led to a surge in the demand for gold.And while there are various forms of gold investments to consider, including gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), gold coins and gold mining stocks, one that has gained considerable traction over the last year is 1-ounce gold bars. One major reason for this is accessibility. Major retailers like Costco started offering 1-ounce gold bars for sale, making it easier for everyday consumers to invest in physical gold. And with a low price point relative to larger gold bars, 1-ounce gold bars offer an affordable way for people to directly own tangible gold.\u00a0But the price of gold has also been climbing, hitting numerous milestones so far this year. That has led the price of physical gold bars to increase in tandem. That, in turn, raises the question of whether 1-ounce gold bars are still worth investing in as prices climb.Ready to get started with gold investing? Find out more about your options here.Are 1-ounce gold bars worth investing in with gold prices climbing?In general, yes, 1-ounce gold bars can still be a worthwhile investment even as gold prices climb \u2014 and there are a few specific attributes of these bars that make them particularly appealing in a high-price environment.\n\n\nOne is that as gold prices increase, larger gold bars become increasingly expensive and out of reach for many investors. By opting for 1-ounce bars instead, investors get an accessible entry point into the gold market, allowing them to participate without committing to a substantial upfront investment. This is especially attractive when gold prices are high, as the lower price point enables investors to start small and gradually build their position.The compact nature of 1-ounce bars allows investors to have precise control over the amount of gold in their portfolios. With these smaller bars, investors can fine-tune their gold allocation more easily than they could with larger bars, which is crucial in a high-price environment where every ounce represents a significant value.When gold prices are elevated, 1-ounce bars also offer superior liquidity compared to larger bars. They're easier to sell in smaller quantities, allowing investors to capitalize on price spikes or address cash needs without liquidating a large portion of their gold holdings.With 1-ounce bars, investors also have the option to spread their gold investments across multiple pieces. This diversification can be advantageous if there's a need to sell gradually over time, especially in a rising price environment where timing can significantly impact returns.\n\n\nAnd while smaller gold pieces typically carry a higher premium over the spot price compared to larger bars, 1-ounce bars strike a balance. These bars usually have a lower premium than coins or fractional-ounce bars, yet are more affordable than larger bars, making them cost-effective in a high-price market.There are other benefits to consider, too. For example, in a rising market, smaller denominations like 1-ounce bars can sometimes appreciate faster in percentage terms than larger bars. This is because the market for smaller bars can be more dynamic, potentially offering better short-term opportunities in a bullish gold environment.Storing and handling large amounts of physical gold can also be challenging and costly \u2014 but investing in 1-ounce gold removes some of those hurdles. These bars are easier to store securely at home or in a safe deposit box, reducing storage costs, which can be a significant factor when gold prices are elevated.That said, there are downsides, and potential investors should be aware of the risks of buying at higher price points. While gold is traditionally seen as a long-term investment, buying 1-ounce bars at their peak may reduce the immediate returns one can expect. So, investors should time their entry carefully, keeping in mind that gold prices can be volatile and driven by global events that may not always be predictable.\u00a0Ultimately, if you're looking to hold onto gold for a long-term hedge against inflation or economic downturns, then 1-ounce bars remain a solid option. For those looking for quick gains, however, the rising price could pose a challenge.Don't miss out on the many benefits of gold investing. Get started now.The bottom lineWhen it comes to gold investing, 1-ounce gold bars are a valuable investment option to consider despite rising prices, especially for those seeking direct ownership of gold without a hefty upfront cost. The liquidity, accessibility and tangible nature of these bars make them a choice worth considering amid climbing gold prices. That said, potential investors may also want to consider the other gold assets available to them, which could offer unique advantages depending on investment goals and market conditions. After all, as with any investment, understanding your options is often the key to making the right decision for your portfolio.\n\n\nAngelica Leicht\n\n\nAngelica Leicht is senior editor for Managing Your Money, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

Catastrophic flooding in the state devastated several towns and killed dozens of people, with the\u00a0North Carolina State Climate Office\u00a0describing the storm as close to being a \"worst-case scenario for western North Carolina.\"\u00a0Art and Light Gallery director Bracken Sansbury told CBS News that three out of four of the Asheville-based artists it represents \"completely lost their studios,\" which means all of their works-in-progress, tools and other inventory were wiped out by the storm.\u00a0Asheville-based painter Jeremy Russell was able to deliver a 20-piece collection of paintings to the gallery hours before the storm hit, Sansbury said.\u00a0\"We installed the show Monday, it's live and active, and we want to sell it out to help him get back on his feet,\" she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelene death toll hits 200, search and rescue missions continue\n06:08\n\nBy contrast, Bucks Sport's Barn, a kids party venue and event space in Atlanta, will be closed for the foreseeable future.

In the aftermath of Helene, Rodgers doesn't anticipate hosting any events in the month of October; his only source of income will be from selling $25 tickets to a haunted house experience hosted in a separate building unscathed by the hurricane.\n\n\n\"It's both kid-friendly and adult scary.

Not only are they big and clunky, but they take up precious storage space in your home. If you want to reclaim a bit of that space for yourself, a small but mighty\u00a0stick vacuum may be the best solution for you.\u00a0The best stick vacuums are lightweight and cordless while still offering strong suction power. Some also come with great extra features, including multiple brush heads, a digital display that allows you to see how much battery life is left, and multi-step HEPA filtration for a deep clean -- perfect for people living with household allergies. If you have pets, a stick vacuum can even help bring down the amount of dander floating around the air.\u00a0With so many stick vacuums on the market though, it can be hard to find the right one for your home. That's why we did all the work for you and rounded up the best stick vacuums of 2024.

That means it's a capable cleaning appliance to help you tackle just about any mess you encounter.\u00a0It includes the brand's clog-reducing Jet Cyclone technology for consistent, powerful suction that stops dirt and debris from building up on the filter. It also has a telescoping tool to help you access hard-to-reach parts of your home for a more thorough clean when you can't reach it with your arms alone.\u00a0\n\n\nA turbo brush specifically conquers carpets, and a digital display keeps you abreast of the power level. That way you aren't halfway through a cleaning job and the vacuum shuts down on you. No one likes it when that happens.\u00a0In addition, its Cleaning Station can automatically empty itself with the push of a button, which means you don't have to dirty your hands trying to tackle that part yourself.\u00a0\n\n                  $400\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 Pet\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDon't let the fact that this stick vacuum is geared toward pet messes fool you. That's just one of the many things it's good at - and its budget price makes it well worth testing to see that. This unit's 450W motor makes it super easy to power through any mess, whether you're cleaning up on carpet or rugs or hardwood flooring. It also tends to target messes with hair thanks to its specially-designed brush to make it simple to clean while getting rid of the other debris it collects while running. \n\n\nWhen you operate the vacuum it will only allow cleaner air to be let out into your home, too, thanks to a four-stage filtration system that captures fine particulates in the air. That means dust and pollen, so you can expect a less allergen-laden house, especially if you do have pets.One of the most exciting aspects of this vacuum is the fact that it can be converted to a portable hand vacuum with a miniature power brush, dusting brush, and crevice tool. To get the best discount, make sure to add the available $90 coupon to your order before checkout.\u00a0\n\n                  $200\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest for pet hair: Shark Pet cordless stick vacuum\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nThis stick vacuum was designed specifically to tackle pet hair on multiple surfaces, including rugs, carpets, tile and hardwood. If you have a dog or cat that's constantly leaving hair everywhere, you'll want to come back to this one again and again.It comes with a HEPA filtration system and an anti-allergen seal that helps trap pet dander as well as other allergens lingering on the floor. This model can be used for 40 minutes before it needs charging.\n\n\nIt doubles as a hand vacuum, so if you find smaller messes that need to be picked up but don't quite necessitate you dragging the entire vacuum out, this is a great option for that, especially for pets.\u00a0\n\n                  $230\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight PetPro\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nThe Shark Ultralight PetPro vacuum weighs just under three pounds, making it the lightest vacuum on this entire list. It features Shark's PowerFin, plus a soft roller so you can seamlessly switch between cleaning carpets and other types of flooring.\u00a0\n\n\nThe cleaning appliance comes outfitted with powerful LED lights on the nozzle to help you locate dirt, dust and pet hair you might typically miss around your home. We also like the odor-neutralizing tech built in, which is great for pet-owning families.\"I love this vacuum,\"\u00a0one Amazon reviewer\u00a0says. \"We have three dogs and it does a tremendous job picking up the dog hair. \n\n\n\"I had a Dyson before this vacuum and I am very pleased with the quality and suction of the Shark.

It features a fifth-generation Hyperdymium motor, spinning at up to 135,000 RPM. Just to put that in perspective, most vacuum motors typically run at 10,000 RPM. A super-fast vacuum might run up to 35,000 RPM.\u00a0The vacuum features a fully sealed, whole-machine HEPA filtration system that can capture 99.99% of particles and 99.9% of viruses.\u00a0\n\n\nIt also includes a Fluffy Optic cleaner head, with a lighting system that can reveal twice the amount of microscopic dust. Dyson engineers designed the new light source to be positioned as low as possible in the endcap of the cleaner head, projecting a blade of light to illuminate particles on floors. It also features a built-in dusting and crevice tool, as well as a power button (instead of the classic trigger).\u00a0The Gen5detect offers up to 70 minutes of suction and a new user interface that can show you when your surface is clean. Bars on the LCD screen also rise and fall according to the volume of particles being removed in real-time.\n\n\nIf you need an appliance that can handle just about anything you need it to, feel free to splurge on this stick vacuum wonder.\u00a0\n\n                  $796\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $950\n            at\n      Dyson\n      \nHow to choose the right stick vacuum for youWant to buy a new stick vacuum? You should consider a few important things first. Check out the kinds of floors in your home. Are they mostly hardwood? Low-pile carpet? Tile? You need to buy a vacuum based on what you'll be cleaning regularly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, consider your home's size and layout. If you have a larger house, look for a vacuum with a long runtime or cord to avoid constant recharging. Pet hair? Get a model with specialized brushes and powerful suction to clean it all up quickly.You'll also need to decide between corded and cordless. Corded vacuums deliver consistent power, great for big cleans. But the cord limits your reach. Cordless models mean you can move from room to room without having to unplug and replug the power cord. Just be aware runtime depends on battery life, which is also something important to look into. Some only last for about an hour, while others can run well past 120 minutes.\n\n\nOf course, suction power is also key. Check the motor wattage and suction ratings. Strong suction gobbles up dirt, dust and debris. For allergy sufferers, look for advanced filtration like HEPA to trap tiny particles and keep the air in your home as clean as possible.\nBrittany Vincent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrittany Vincent has been covering gaming, tech, and all things entertainment for 16 years for a variety of online and print publications.

Hands-on review", "Author": "Leslie Gornstein", "Date": "September 27, 2024 / 5:20 PM EDT", "content": "\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nApple just released its latest lineup of iPhones, which include the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, but when comparing these new phones to last year's models, the updates seem a bit lackluster -- offering just small improvements and a handful of promises.Having owned every iPhone model since the original was released in 2007, I've always been one of the early-adopters and have purchased the latest model as soon as Apple begins accepting preorders. This year was no different. I preordered the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 512GB of internal storage in the new desert titanium color. It replaced my iPhone 15 Pro Max, also with 512GB of storage.\u00a0Keep reading to learn more about this phone and whether it's worth upgrading, or if you should stick with the iPhone model you're currently using.Pro Tip: If you're thinking about making the switch from an\u00a0Android phone to an iPhone 16, we've got you covered with our coverage of five reasons to make the transition.\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \n\n\n\nWho should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max?\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in four new colors, with a housing made from titanium.\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple's top-of-the-line smartphone and the model with the largest display. It's designed for those who need the fastest performance possible, and who can benefit from having the largest smartphone display that Apple has to offer. This smartphone is designed to be a high-performance communications device that can also serve as a productivity, entertainment, health/fitness and safety tool, as well as a powerful still image and video camera.This is the iPhone you want if you're interested in taking pro-quality photos or shooting video at up to 4K (120fps) resolution. Thanks to its Apple A18 Pro processor, it's also the model that can handle high-end gaming or tasks that require a tremendous amount of processing power.\u00a0\n\n\nUnless you need both the added processing power of the A18 Pro chip (that's available in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) and want the additional on-screen real estate offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, one of Apple's less expensive iPhones may be more suitable for you.iPhone 16 Pro Max: At a glance\n\n\n            \n                Jason R.

The CPU is up to 15% faster, while the GPU runs up to 20% faster. That said, being a \"power user,\" when working with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I never once thought to myself, \"Gee, this smartphone is too slow,\" nor did I ever become frustrated by any unwanted lagging -- even when playing high-end, graphic-intensive games. This makes me wonder if even more processing power is worth the investment.\n\n\nThe phone also now supports Wi-Fi 7, as opposed to Wi-Fi 6E. And battery life is more efficient, compared to last year's model. You can expect up to four additional hours of runtime per charge.\u00a0\nThe new Camera Control button is located on the side of the iPhone 16 phones.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \nThe two significant new features are the Camera Control button that's located on the side of the smartphone, as well as the Apple Intelligence (AI) integration that will soon be part of a yet-to-be-released version of iOS 18. This AI functionality is expected to be released later this fall. The only users who will benefit from the Camera Control button are those who heavily use their iPhone to take photos or shoot video -- and even then, using the Camera Control button is optional.\n\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max's housing is now made using Grade 5 titanium, which is lightweight and incredibly durable. Plus, to make the display slightly larger than last year's model, Apple has decreased the size of the bezel around the screen. This allows for a 6.9-inch display, compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.6-inch display. This display size difference is inconsequential.\u00a0\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \nWill Apple Intelligence make the iPhone smarter?At the moment, that's a difficult question to answer, since Apple Intelligence will not be introduced into any iPhones until later this fall. However, what we expect is a more personalized Siri digital assistant that not only understands what's being said, but also the context that's used when making requests or asking questions.\u00a0\n\n\nApple Intelligence will allow apps to more seamlessly work together and exchange relevant information in a way that can streamline common tasks, while helping users maintain their privacy and security. Apple Intelligence will also help with composing text. When used as an audio recording device, it will be able to transcribe and then summarize recordings. AI-assisted language translations and more seamless scheduling and to-do list management have also been promised.For someone who takes a lot of pictures or shoots video, Apple Intelligence introduces easier to use and more powerful image enhancement and editing tools, such as the Clean Up feature offered by the Photos app that can be used to remove unwanted objects from photos. This feature works decently, but only in certain situations. AI can also assist in the actual picture taking or video shooting process to ensure the best possible results. However, until Apple actually unlocks all of the Apple Intelligence features, it's difficult to predict how useful the AI-driven functionality will actually be.\n\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Photography and videography\n\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \nFrom a hardware standpoint, the improvements made to the iPhone 16 Pro Max's camera system aren't dramatic. However, Apple has made major enhancements to both the Camera and Photos apps that come preinstalled with iOS 18. This gives the camera system new capabilities. Combined with the faster processor, overall camera performance is noticeably better. There are also more tools for taking, editing, enhancing, organizing and sharing photos and video content.Most noticeable is the addition of the Camera Control button. This physical button on the side of the phone can be used to quickly launch the Camera app, adjust the app's settings, and then work as a shutter button. The result is an experience that's closer to using a traditional point-and-shoot camera than ever before. Of course, all of the camera controls and options previously available via the touchscreen continue to be offered. Thus, the Camera Control button provides an alternative and optional way to work with the Camera app.\n\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is now able to shoot video at 4K (120fps) resolution with support for Dolby Vision. This is the highest resolution and frame rate an iPhone has ever offered. This is combined with enhanced spatial audio recording capabilities when shooting video, so it's easier to capture and create more immersive and visually compelling content.The still photography options are also enhanced. There are two upgraded 48MP cameras and one 12MP camera on the back of the phone, which support both the ProRAW and HEIF photo file formats. This allows users to capture a higher level of detail, even in low light situations. Using digital zoom capabilities, you now get up to 25x zoom. The phone's macro (extreme close-up) capabilities have been enhanced, too.\n\n\nThe behind-the-scenes processing that happens when shooting photos or video allows the phone to capture more accurate colors, including more life-like skin tones. And with the help of Photographic Styles, it's easier to infuse your own creativity when creating content.The redesign of the Photos app offers more features and control over the stored images. However, the redesigned interface is not as intuitive as it once was. It's different enough that it's been taking me time to acclimate to the new design (and I have been using the beta version of iOS 18 on the iPhone 15 Pro Max for over a month already). I fear some users will find the new interface downright confusing.\n\n\nSample images taken using the iPhone 16 Pro Max\nThis is an example of the customizable Photographic Styles now offered by the Camera app.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nUsing the Macro and Portrait shooting mode together, you get customizable control over an images depth of field.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThe 48MP Fusion camera on of the back of the iPhone does a nice job capturing wide shows with vibrant color.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nUsers now get more creative control when transforming a full-color image into black and white.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max does an excellent job capturing detail using the Macro shooting mode.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThis is an example of the new Clean Up feature in the Photos app that allows you to quickly remove unwanted objects from images. I found this feature works adequately, but I've had better results using the Heal tool in third-party apps, like Photoshop Express and TouchRetouch.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n5 differences between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\n\n            \n                Jason R Rich\n\n                          \nThe iPhone 16 offers a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch display.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus run using the Apple 18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are equipped with the faster and more powerful A18 Pro chip.The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of internal storage, while the iPhone 16 offers 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of internal storage (with no 1TB option).The resolution of the iPhone 16 is lower than what's offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max -- 2,556 x 1,179 pixels versus 2,868 x 1,320 pixels.The iPhone 16 offers two rear-facing cameras, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has three rear-facing cameras, so users get more creative control and option when taking pictures or filming video.Is the iPhone 16 Pro Max worth it?The best way to see how well the iPhone 16 Pro Max performs, outside of photography or videography, is to push its processing power by playing graphic-intensive games. I installed and played \"Diabolo Immortal.\" Visually, this is one of the more advanced iPhone games available from the App Store, and it looks and sounds fantastic on this phone.\u00a0\n\n\n            \n                Diablo Immortal\n\n                          \nAnother new thing is the ability to further customize the appearance of what appears on the iPhone's screen. For savvy users, these added features are fun to work with. However, for someone who's already overwhelmed by all of the iPhone's customizable options, navigating through the Settings app and personalizing the phone is now a more convoluted process.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd love to say that anyone who is using an older iPhone or Android phone should switch to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I am not comfortable making this claim. Instead, I'd certainly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max to anyone who is using an iPhone that's three or more years old. These people who will see the greatest improvement in overall performance, especially if they want a larger screen, too.However, if you're an iPhone 15 Pro Max user thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the only significant enhancement is the addition of the Camera Control button, since both phones can run the latest version of iOS 18 and will take advantage of Apple Intelligence once it's released.\u00a0Design: With the exception of the additional Camera Control button and slightly larger display, the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is very similar to last year's model. I do really like the new and more sophisticated looking casing color options, however.Performance: Yes, the iPhone 16 Pro Max can perform faster. This will potentially be beneficial when using Apple Intelligence functionality, but for everyday tasks, it makes little difference.Value: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expensive. Unless you need the extra processing power and larger display, you can save money upgrading to the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Plus is a middle option, but for slightly more money, most users will appreciate the enhanced performance of the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max.AI integration: The NPU is certainly powerful, but how well Apple integrates Apple Intelligence into iOS 18 and core apps is yet to be seen.\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \n\n\n\nFor in-depth reviews of the Apple iPhone 16 Pro,\u00a0Google Pixel 9,\u00a0Google Pixel 9 Pro,\u00a0Google Pixel 9 Pro XL,\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6,\u00a0Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,\u00a0OnePlus 12\u00a0and other popular phones, check out our ever-expanding\u00a0tech coverage.In:\n          Apple\nSmartphone\niPhone\n\nJason R.

It offers excellent heat retention, a one-touch cleaning system, a thermometer built into the lid and durable steel construction. The grill is also available in your choice of copper, black or green.\u00a0Enjoy 363 square inches of premium cooking space from this 22-inch grill.\u00a0 This is enough space to prepare 13 burgers at once. It offers a porcelain-enameled bowl and lid, along with a plated steel-hinged cooking grate. The lid height is 7.5 inches.\n\n\nAs you're cooking, the charcoal ash falls into a high-capacity catcher tray that's easily removable when it needs to be emptied. Without even having to lift the lid, you can control the grill's temperature by adjusting its dampers. When you close the dampers completely, this cuts off oxygen flow and extinguishes the coals. And the lid's handle has a built-in heat shield that keeps it from getting too hot.\u00a0Between its classic design, durability and ease of use, you can't go wrong with this Original Kettle Premium grill from Weber. And it's offered at a great price, too.\n\n                  $239\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest portable charcoal\u00a0grill: Cuisinart CCG-190\n\n\n            \n                Cuisinart\n\n                          \nThe biggest benefit of this charcoal grill is that it can be set up virtually anywhere outdoors, so you can take it on a camping trip, set it up at a tailgate party, park it on a patio, or tuck it onto a deck.The entire unit measures just 14.5 x 14.5 x 15 inches and weighs a mere two pounds. To keep everything together during transport, it has three built-in lid locks. The grill also includes an ash catcher and a dual venting system.\n\n\nThis Cuisinart grill is available in black with a red cover or all black. For cooking space, there's a full 196 square inches. And the cooking rack is chrome-plated, so it helps to distribute heat more evenly.\u00a0A slightly larger model is also available ($36). It offers the same design, but 200 square inches of cooking space.\n\n                  $24\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest value charcoal grill: Royal Gourmet CC1830\n\n\n            \n                Royal Gourmet\n\n                          \nThis charcoal grill from Royal Gourmet is certainly not the least expensive on the market, but its mere $100 price tag makes it a really good value. It'll make an excellent addition to your backyard space.The grill offers a primary 443-square-inch cooking space that uses a porcelain-enameled steel wire cooking grate. This is accompanied by an 184-square-inch, chrome-plated steel wire warming rack. When you're done cooking, simply close the lid and the side air vent to extinguish the coals faster. The removable charcoal pan makes ash disposal easy.\n\n\nThe Royal Gourmet CC1830 has a six-pound charcoal capacity and a two-level height-adjustable fire pan. The bottom shelf that's built into the unit can hold up to 20 pounds. There's also a built-in side tablet that provides some extra space for food prep.You can opt to purchase the grill on its own, or for $128, you'll get the grill and a complete 13-piece grilling set as a bundle.\n\n                  $100\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest charcoal grill for large groups: Royal Gourmet CC2036F\n\n\n            \n                Royal Gourmet\n\n                          \nFrom the popular Royal Gourmet CC2036F charcoal grill, you get a vast 1,200 square inches of total cooking space, which makes preparing food for a large group a breeze. In addition to offering a classic barrel grill design, this model includes a smoker, which provides added cooking options.\u00a0 All of the cooking grates are made from porcelain-enameled steel wire.\n\n\nThe grill is primarily constructed from alloy steel. It measures 29.92 x 65.94 x 51.18 inches and weighs 87.5 pounds. Built into the base are two wheels, which makes positioning the grill easier.\u00a0Once this grill heats up, it'll be ready to prepare food for eight to 10 people at once. The 1,200 square inches of cooking space is divided into three areas -- a 668-square-inch primary cooking space, a 260-square-inch warming rack and a 272-square-inch offset smoker. The smoker attaches to the main body of the grill.\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary cooking area takes advantage of a three-level adjustable charcoal pan, which can hold up to 7.7 pounds of charcoal. The smoker unit holds up to 2.6 pounds of charcoal. When it comes to quick cleanup, the grill has a grease drip cup and a removable charcoal pan. Built into the grill's lid is a handy thermometer.\u00a0\n\n                  $229\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest kamado charcoal grill: NewAge Products Platinum 22\" kamado grill\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nThis premium-quality kamado charcoal grill is a must have for any backyard. It provides the ultimate grilling experience, while capturing that unique taste that only this type of grill can provide.\u00a0\n\n\nThanks to its 22-inch diameter, the grill gives you an impressive 450 square inches of cooking space. You get full control over temperature, too. It's able to maintain an accurate and even temperature between 225 degrees and 750 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0This grill is available in three finishes. It comes with everything you need to enjoy a robust grilling experience, no matter what types of foods you're preparing. Along with the grill itself, you get an expander grate, a hang cooking set, a grate griller, a charcoal chimney starter, a charcoal tray and a charcoal zone divider. A stainless steel stand, created just for this grill, is sold separately.\u00a0\n\n\nWe adore this grill's features. It has a solid ceramic firebox that's complemented with natural teak handles. In other words, the Platinum Kamado is built for durability, heat retention and even heat distribution. You also get 8 millimeter stainless steel grates.\u00a0Another notable feature is that the grill comes with a patent-pending ash bucket. It collects almost all the ash. So, once the kamado is cool to the touch, you can easily lift it up and dump the ash. This makes clean-up a breeze.\n\n                  $1,300\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest premium charcoal grill:\u00a0Kamado Joe Classic III\n\n\n            \n                Kamado Joe\n\n                          \nIf you're looking for a charcoal grill that not only makes a bold visual statement but also offers a ton of useful features, we recommend the Kamado Joe Classic III charcoal grill. It comes in a blaze-red color with black accents and measures 24 x 42 x 41.98 inches.\u00a0When you open the lid, you'll discover an 18-inch-wide, circular ceramic cooking grate. The grill's base is made from heavy-duty galvanized steel and has a rolling cart design with locking wheels.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the most interesting things about this grill is that it offers a patent-pending design that creates a hyperbolic smoke chamber. In other words, Harvard science transforms the Kamado Joe grill into one of the world's best smokers. By distributing smoke and heat in rolling, recirculating waves, the cooking chamber surrounds food in clouds of delicious smoke, while evenly distributing heat. This results in enhanced flavor, with significantly reduced hot spots.This grill is also equipped with a handy, multi-level, half-moon design that allows you to cook different foods in different styles at different temperatures -- at the same time. The top vent helps you maintain a consistent air setting for precise airflow management during dome opening and closing.\u00a0\n\n\nWe love that the Classic III is constructed of powder-coated cast aluminum. The dual-adjustment top vent is rain- and mold-resistant. It allows you to smoke from 225 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. So while you'll pay more for this premium grill, what you get for your investment is added flavor, versatility, durability and efficiency.\n\n                  $1,900\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nHow to choose a charcoal grillWith so many options when it comes to charcoal grills, here are five things to consider:\u00a0Overall size: Based on the size of your yard, patio or porch, make sure your grill will fit safely within that space, without posing a fire risk if it's set up too close to your home, decking, or overhanging trees.Cooking space: This impacts how much food you can make at once. Keep in mind that some grill brands include the warming rack in their calculations for overall cooking space. For a family of four, 400 to 500 square inches of cooking space is enough. For eight to 10 people, you'll want 650 and 800 square inches of primary cooking space. A wider cooking space is best for preparing a rack of ribs. If you plan to grill a large turkey, also pay attention to the height of the cooking space.Grill grates: Most grill grates are made from stainless steel, porcelain enameled cast iron, or porcelain enameled steel. All of these options are durable and easy to clean. When cooking steak, these grate materials create impressive sear marks.Materials and durability: For the main housing of a charcoal grill, you want a durable material that retains heat well. Stainless steel, cast iron, enamel or sheet metal are the most common options. Out of these, stainless steel is the strongest material. It can withstand outdoor conditions the best.Ease of cleanup: Charcoal dust and grease can make a mess. Get a grill that offers a design and uses materials that are easy to clean, but be sure to follow the cleaning directions in the owner's manual to prevent damage to the grill or the possibility of mixing harmful chemicals into your food.\nJason R.

It's an entry-level\u00a0action camera\u00a0that can serve as either a point-and-shoot still-image camera or versatile video camera.

It's also waterproof down to 16 feet and features a long-lasting rechargeable battery\n\n\nThere are more than 35 GoPro mounts and accessories available for this camera, but it works nicely on its own, with a handheld grip, or a tabletop tripod (such the\u00a0GoPro Shorty,\u00a0The Handler\u00a0or\u00a0GoPro 3-Way 2.0). A\u00a0microSD memory card\u00a0is also required and sold separately.The GoPro Hero features a 1.76-inch, full-color, LCD touchscreen on the back and it can operate in temperatures between 14 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0\n\n                  $200\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nA gift that goes airbore: DJI Neo\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor beginner drone pilots of all ages, the new DJI Neo can be controlled using any smartphone or the optional DJI handheld controller. Neo is a feature-packed, but ultra-small and light drawn that sets up in seconds and is incredibly easy to fly. It even comes with three rechargeable battery packs (and the charger), but each battery only lasts for around 15 minutes of flying time.What we absolutely love about this drone is that it can takeoff and land from the palm of a hand. It has automatic stabilization (even in slightly windy conditions) and the Neo is able to capture gorgeous 4K resolution video using it's built in camera.\n\n\nThanks to the full-coverage propeller guards, the Neo can withstand minor crashes and won't accidentally harm a user's fingers. Don't be fooled by this drone's size or price, it's definitely not a toy. It is, however, easy enough for anyone over the age of 10 to fly. The smartphone app for the Neo offers integrated flying modes that can be activated with the touch of an on-screen icon, but it also responds to voice commands given via a phone. Our in-house tech gurus tested out this drone and had a blast flying it, so we know whomever you gift it to will love it.\n\n                  $199\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nPerfect for the mobile gamer: Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition\n\n\n            \n                Nintendo\n\n                          \nThe Nintendo Switch Lite runs virtually all of the most popular Switch games (except for those that require a Joy-Con controller).

It addition to a sleek and thin design, the laptop's exterior was inspired by nature. And thanks to it's competitive price, it makes a excellent gift.For starters, the S 16 is a mere 0.43 inches thick when shut. And the laptop offers a smooth and simple appearance that relies on a durable and water resistant outer housing that's made from Ceraluminum -- a fusion of ceramic and aluminum that's widely used in the aerospace industry.\n\n\nSure, the Zenbook S 16 looks beautiful on the outside, but it's the inner workings of this laptop that make it to stand out. One highlight is its 16-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits maximum brightness. The laptop is powered using an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor with a dedicated AI NPU. And for graphics, you get a AMD Radeon 880m GPU.Combine this with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for internal storage, along with a quick-charging battery, and the result is a powerful and versatile Windows laptop. The internal six speaker system was co-designed by Harman Kardon. For video calling and other tasks, the Zenbook S 16 has a built-in, 1080p resolution webcam. Plus, the laptop is chock full of ports.\u00a0\n\n\nEven without using the Copilot + PC AI capabilities, this is a standout laptop. However, when you start using the AI, this greatly expands how the laptop can be used, for tasks like texting, transcribing audio recordings, doing in-depth research, organizing a schedule, making content creation easier, and so much more. The latest AI functionality is just one keypress away, thanks to the Copilot key on its backlit keyboard. All this computing power is packaged in a laptop that costs just $1,200.\u00a0\n\n                  $1,200\n            at\n      Best Buy\n      \nFor kids and tweens who want an iPad: Apple iPad (9th Generation)\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nRight now, you can get a brand-new, Wi-Fi-only\u00a0Apple iPad (9th Generation) tablet\u00a0with 64GB of internal storage for just $199 at Amazon, which is an incredible deal, making it a great time to grab someone an amazing gift.\n\n\nThe iPad (9th Generation) boasts more than 67,500 customer reviews on Amazon and has earned 4.8 stars out of five, so you know people love it. It's the perfect starter\u00a0tablet for kids and teens, or anyone who wants the capabilities of an iPad without paying top dollar for an\u00a0Apple iPad Pro\u00a0or iPad Air.The ninth-generation iPad tablet isn't the latest model. It features the slightly older Apple A13 Bionic processor, but it does run the same version of iPadOS and includes the full suite of apps available on the current iPad models. This tablet is equipped with a 10.2 inch (2,160 by 1,620-pixel resolution) Retina touchscreen display, along with a 12MP front camera and 8MP rear camera. The battery lasts for about 10 hours per charge. Choose between a space gray or silver casing color.\n\n                  $199\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor avid readers on the move: Boox Palma e-reader\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor people who enjoy reading, there are a bunch of really great e-readers from brands like Amazon, Kobo and Boox that offer lightweight devices that are waterproof and easy to view in almost any lighting situation. Some even have full-color, digital ink displays.However the Boox Palma is the only truly hand-held e-reader. It's about the same size as a typical smartphone, but instead of an OLED display, it relies on a digital ink display that's easy on the eyes. In addition to fitting in the palm of a hand or pocket and being waterproof, what readers love about the Palma is that it offers distraction-free reading.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen paired with Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, the Palma also works as an audiobook and podcast player. Plus, it can serve as a simple device that displays and manages personalized information thanks to optional widgets.The 6.13-inch digital ink touchscreen display offers 824 x 1,648 pixel (300 pixels-per-inch) resolution. It comes with 128GB of internal storage, which is enough to hold thousands of e-books or hundreds of audiobooks. More storage can be added by inserting an optional microSD memory card.\u00a0\n\n\nOne other notable feature is that the device relies on the Android 11 operating system, so optional apps can be downloaded and installed via the Google Play Store. However, the Palma is not suitable for displaying video or detailed photographs. It is mainly designed to make text very easy to read, without causing eye fatigue during long reading sessions.For someone who wants a truly compact e-reader, the Palma measures just 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.31 inches and weighs a mere 6 ounces. The rechargeable battery lasts for several weeks.\n\n                  $280\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor Chromebook fans who want AI: Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3\n\n\n            \n                Lenovo\n\n                          \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro tablet is a popular, two-in-one device that runs Windows 11 with Copilot+ PC functionality. It can serve as a versatile tablet which the user can write on using a stylus, or it can be used as a laptop when a detachable keyboard is added. The problem: This device is expensive (priced around $1,000 without the keyboard).For someone who would benefit from a powerful, lightweight and versatile device that comes with a keyboard, and that's priced starting at just $280, there's the Lenovo Duet 3. This two-in-one device is a Chromebook, which means it runs using the ChromeOS operating system (not Windows) and relies heavily on cloud applications and storage.\n\n\nThe Duet 3 features an 11-inch touchscreen display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 400 nits. It's a great option for budget-conscious adults, but is also nicely equipped for elementary or middle school students. And it supports the latest Google Gemini AI tools and features. Battery life is up to 12 hours.\u00a0People love the Duet 3 because it weighs just 1.14 pounds and is water-resistant. It also has a stereo speaker system, a front- and rear-facing camera, as well as two USB Type-C ports. In other words, you get an impressive amount of computing power at a very affordable price.\u00a0\n\n\nBe sure to check out our 2024 Chromebook Plus buyer's guide\u00a0for more information about the latest Chromebook laptops and what they offer.\n\n                  $280 and up\n            at\n      Lenovo\n      \nFor enjoying music and more: Apple AirPods Pro 2\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nApple AirPods Pro 2 are currently the top-of-the-line wireless earbuds in Apple's lineup. Out of the three options, this is the model we recommend the most highly because it integrates more features that enable the earbuds to produce significantly better sound quality and overall performance. Its wireless charge case supports USB-C charging. These wireless earbuds have also been approved by the FDA to serve as\u00a0over-the-counter hearting aids.\n\n\nWith these earbuds, you get additional features like adaptive audio, active noise cancellation, a transparency mode, a conversation awareness feature and onboard touch controls. Not to be confused with the lower-end AirPods 4, the AirPods Pro 2 use Apple's next-generation H2 headphone chip. The dust, sweat and waterproof rating of the AirPods Pro 2 is IP54, which makes them a bit more durable for those looking for\u00a0earbuds for the gym.The good news is that while their suggested retail price is $249, we've seen them regularly go on sale.\n\n\nIf you're confused about which version of the popular Apple AirPods is best suited to the person you're seeking a gift for, our team of consumer technology experts has written an\u00a0AirPods buyer's guide for 2024\u00a0that'll help you make the right choice.\n\n                  $183\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor someone who cares for their lawn: Mammotion Luba 2 AWD 1000\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nLike many of the\u00a0newest robotic lawn mowers, this one does not require a perimeter cable. For precision navigation, it relies on GPS, RTK and built-in 3D cameras, along with data provided by its mobile app. This allows for quick initial setup and the ability to create virtual boundaries with multiple zones.\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the app, the user can easily set up different mowing tasks for multiple work areas. This includes setting separate schedules, cutting modes and cutting heights for each zone. It handles slopes as easily as flat terrain thanks to \"off-road\" tires and suspension. Meanwhile, its internal cameras have a 220-degree field of view, which gives it excellent obstacle-avoidance capabilities. It can detect and avoid items as small as two inches.\u00a0One fun feature that sets the Luba 2 AWD 1000 apart from its competition is that it can -- and you're reading this right --\u00a0create lawn art. From the mobile app, you can choose different patterns or create custom designs. The mower uses advanced algorithms to adjust the cutting height and angle to recreate the pattern in your lawn.\u00a0\n\n\nThe mower cuts grass and handles edge cutting with extreme precision, in part because of its internal technologies. On a fully charged battery, it operates for up to two hours before automatically returning to its charging dock. Since it offers an IPX6 waterproof rating, you can easily clean it with a garden hose. Other versions of the Luba 2 can handle larger lawns (up to 2.5 acres). This is not the least expensive robot mower available, but based on its performance, technology and overall quality, the Luba 2 AWD 1000 offers a really good value for the investment. It's a great gift for anyone who does not enjoy manually mowing their lawn using a traditional push mower.\n\n                  $2,499\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor the avid PC Gamer: Dell UltraSharp 40 curved Thunderbolt Hub monitor\n\n\n            \n                Dell\n\n                          \nOne of the ways PC gamers are able to immerse themselves in the virtual worlds they choose to experience is through the use of a high-resolution, curved monitor.

So, whether it's used for gaming, content creation, or other types of work, this monitor can do it all -- and do it well.

However, back in 2016, the company dropped out of the television market -- that is, until now. In September, Panasonic re-entered the television marketplace with several high-end TV models with specifications and features that rival what the current bestselling TVs offer.The new Panasonic Z95 series TV comes in a handful of screen sizes, including this popular 65-inch model. It's equipped with a 4K OLED display with an extremely fast 144Hz refresh rate. It also provides Dolby Vision IQ, HLG and HDR10+ support. What this means is that the TV is able to showcase live sports, action movies and game content -- presenting it using an incredibly smooth, fluid, color-accurate and detailed picture.\n\n\nThis TV's built in, seven channel speaker system feature 360-degree Soundscape Pro audio tuned by Technics. This relies on integrated front-array, upward and side-firing speakers with Dolby Atmos support. And for gamers, the Z95A offers VRR, AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync support. Because this Panasonic TV is powered using the popular Amazon FireTV OS, it performs nicely as an all-in-one entertainment system that comes with a voice remote control and support for the Amazon Alexa digital assistant.Anyone who wants a new TV with cutting-edge features from a premium brand will appreciate receiving the new Panasonic Z95A as a gift this holiday season. The TV offers a great reason to splurge on a gift for someone you love -- that the entire family will enjoy for years to come.\n\n                  $3,000\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor coffee lovers: Bruvi Brewer smart coffee maker\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nYou're probably familiar with K-Cup coffee pods. Well, the Bruvi Brewer is a single-serve coffee making system that uses B-Pods.This coffee maker has a built in water filter. It's also Wi-Fi enabled, so you can pair it with your smartphone to control, personalize and monitor the coffee brewing process. The Bruvi offers variety when it comes to hot or cold beverage making. It prepares coffee, high-pressure espresso, Americanos, cold brew, iced coffee, infused coffee and tea.\n\n\nUse the Bruvi mobile app to brew remotely from your phone, schedule brews in advance, auto re-order B-Pods and access a personalized consumption dashboard. The Bruvi bundle includes the brewer itself, a variety pack of 20 B-Pods and a replaceable water filter. The built in tank holds up to 70 ounces of water.One standout feature is that the coffee goes straight to your mug, without touching the insides of the brewer. This allows for a more hygienic brew, with no flavor cross-contamination and no daily rising required. The pods come in packages of 24 and are available in a wide range of flavors and types. Keep in mind, K-Cup pods and B-Pods are not cross-compatible. This brewer only uses the company's own pods.\n\n                  $348\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor watching movies on any wall: Yaber T2 Plus indoor/outdoor projector\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIt a tech-oriented world that's now filled with ultra-large screen TV options, there's a more budget-friendly way to enjoy TV shows, movies, games and more -- indoors or outdoors -- on a projection screen that's up to 120-inches. The Yaber T2 Plus is a portable, 1080p resolution projector that can be plugged into an external power source or operated using an internal rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 2.5 hours.This projector offers a maximum brightness of 450 lumens, so it provides a decently bright and crisp picture, even if the viewing area is not totally dark. The projector's internal JBL stereo speakers support Dolby sound. One other notable feature is that the projector offers a 1.25:1 throw ratio. Combine this with an aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9, and 50 percent zoom, and you get a customizable viewing experience.\n\n\nThe T2 does not offer smart TV functionality, but it's easy to plug a Google Chromecast TV stick or streaming dongle (sold separately) into the projector's USB port. We like that the projector has a built in handle and weighs just 8.7 pounds.\u00a0\n\n                  $360\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n Wireless earbuds for audiophiles: Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 \n\n\n            \n                Bowers & Wilkins\n\n                          \nA new design, enhanced technology and Bowers & Wilkins' audio expertise combine once again to offer premium, ergonomically designed wireless earbuds that are able to provide better high-frequency detail and capture every detail in your music.

However, the Oiiwak 15-inch Triple Portable Monitor takes that concept a step further.\u00a0 \n\n\nThis portable monitor setup is compatible with most MacBook or Windows PC laptops that have a screen between 13 and 15-inches.

This single unit allows someone to connect two additional 15-inch, 1080p resolution monitors (with a 60Hz refresh rate) to their laptop using a convenient and easy to set up mounting system. The two additional monitors fold up as a single unit for easy transport. Attaching them to the back of a laptop computer's existing monitor using the all metal mounting system takes just a minute or two. Each monitor then connects to the computer using a separate USB Type-C cable. Thanks to plug-and-play technology, no special drivers or software is required. \n\n                  $800\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For gamers and computer users who like color: SteelSeries Apex Pro HyperMagnetic Gaming Keyboard \n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIf there's a gamer on your holiday gift list, giving them a popular and feature-packed, full-size gaming keyboard with integrated RGB lighting will take their PC gaming to the next level. Not only does this keyboard offer a really fast response rate, it also has a small, built in OLED display in the top-right corner that displays the computer and keyboard's current settings and status. This SteelSeries Apex Pro gaming keyboard uses OmniPoint 2.0 adjustable HyperMagnetic switches and offers 20x faster actuation and 11x faster response that a traditional mechanical keyboard. In fact, the user can choose between 40 levels of per-key actuation and utilize 2-in-1 action keys to fully customize their gaming experiences based on the game they're playing.\u00a0 \n\n\nThis is a well made, nicely designed, 104-key gaming keyboard that comes with a detachable wrist rest. The programmable RGB lighting offers a really nice visual element. The keyboard is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Xbox and PlayStation. It offers all of the key features a gamer could want from a keyboard and it makes a really sweet gift. \n\n                  $168\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor any laptop computer user: Espresso Display 17 Pro portable monitor\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor anyone who spends a lot of time working on their laptop computer, the Espresso 17 Pro portable monitor provides one important feature -- it can double a computer's onscreen real estate. This can allow the user to be more productive and more easily multitask.\u00a0 \n\n\nIts 17.3-inch touchscreen display offers 4K or 1080p resolution with a 60Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 440 nits. It also works with any Windows laptop or MacBook. It's a plug-and-play monitor that has built-in speakers and two USB Type-C ports. The monitor takes just seconds to set up (with no special software or drivers required) and it's powered using a single USB Type-C cable that connects to the computer. Since it's a touchscreen, the Espresso portable monitor works with a stylus too.\u00a0 There are several key features that set the Espresso portable monitor apart from others. It's lightweight (2.4 pounds) and thin (just 0.35 inches). It also comes with a screen protector for use when traveling. Plus, it has an optional adjustable stand that attaches to the back of the monitor using magnets, making it one of the very few portable monitors with height and viewing angle adjustability. We highly recommend getting this monitor and optional stand together, so it can accommodate anyone's work habits. The monitor can be used in landscape or portrait mode, which expands its versatility. Oh, and this portable monitor can be used with most smartphones and gaming consoles too. \n\n\nThe slightly scaled-down and more affordable Espresso 15-inch portable display ($499) is also available and is ideal for someone who doesn't need 4K resolution or a 17-inch screen with them when on the go. For anyone who needs a portable monitor, this one offers just about every key feature someone could want. It offers 4K resolution, uses touchscreen technology with stylus support and can display 16.2 million colors. \n\n                  $799\n            at\n      Espresso Displays\n      \n For an avid reader who wants a color display: Kobo Clara Colour\n\n\n            \n                Rakuten\n\n                          \nFor the price, the Kobo Clara Colour is one of the best e-reader deals right now, mainly because it can do everything a typical Amazon Kindle can do, but it also offers a full-color digital ink display. This makes it particularly useful for reading e-books that contain color, as well as graphic novels, and the digital editions of magazines and newspapers.\n\n\nThis e-reader offers a six inch, glare-free display. The unit itself is lightweight and easy to hold in your hands during extended reading sessions. Unlike a traditional tablet, the full-color display on this e-reader features a soothing color palette and offers a built-in highlighter feature, so you can choose a highlight color and mark up books or digital publications as you're reading.We're also fans of the Kobo Clara Colour because it's waterproof. You can take it into the bathtub or read while sunbathing at a pool or beach and never have to worry about getting the device wet. E-books, digital publications and audiobooks can be purchased from the\u00a0Kobo e-bookstore, which offers a very similar selection as the Kindle e-bookstore. The e-reader also supports OverDrive and Libby, so you can borrow e-books and audiobooks from your local public library for free.\u00a0\n\n\nFor avid readers or people who love listening to audiobooks, Rakuten offers the Kobo Plus Read ($7.99 per month), Kobo Plus Listen ($7.99 per month), and Kobo Plus Read & Listen ($9.99 per month) services. Kobo Plus Read gives you unlimited access to more than 1.5 million e-books, while the Kobo Plus Listen plan offers unlimited access to more than 150,000 audiobooks. The Kobo Plus Read & Listen plan offers access to both services at a deeply discounted rate.\n\n                  $150\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor someone who wants to record memories: DJI Osmo Pocket 3\n\n\n            \n                DJI\n\n                          \nIn some ways, the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 camera resembles an action camera, but that's not it's intended purpose. It's not waterproof or incredibly durable, but it is perfect for someone who wants to carry around a tiny and versatile 4K video camera that's perfect for capturing family video, vacation video, vlogging or live streaming. \n\n\nThe Pocket 3 features a tiny camera that's mounted on a three-axis gimbal, so any video that's recorded will look incredibly smooth. Thanks to its one-inch CMOS sensor, this camera is able to record 4K video at up to 120fps. The Osmo Pocket 3 also takes still images. The camera itself has a two-inch OLED color touchscreen that rotates. This screen features a maximum brightness of 700 nits, so it's easy to see in sunlight. Not only is this camera incredibly easy to operate, thanks to its intuitive user interface, but the photos and video content it's able to capture and store on a microSD memory card are visually stunning and detailed. The entire camera weighs less than 6.4 ounces and easily fits in a hand or in a pocket when it's not being used.\u00a0 \n\n\nIf you're looking for a more durable action camera from DJI, you can't go wrong with the new DJI Osmo Action 5 ($349). This is an excellent alternative to a GoPro camera that's loaded with features that outdoor adventurers and content creators alike will absolutely love.\n\n                  $519\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $519\n            at\n      DJI\n      \n Give someone's TV a major sound enhancement: Bose Smart Ultra soundbar \n\n\n            \n                Bose\n\n                          \nOne of the biggest problems with some big screen TVs -- whether they're 55 inches, 85 inches or anywhere in between -- is that their sound quality often leaves a lot to be desired. It's simply not up to par with a TV's impressive picture quality. The easiest remedy for this (and to create a more cinematic and immersive viewing experience within a home) is to connect a soundbar to the TV. \n\n\nThe new Bose Smart Ultra soundbar is the company's latest and most advanced model, designed to work seamlessly with virtually any TV. Utilizing artificial intelligence and Dolby Atmos technology, it can replicate surround sound without requiring a separate subwoofer and rear speakers, though these can be added for an authentic surround sound experience. This soundbar also offers a special dialogue mode, so if someone has trouble hearing the voices in a TV show or movie when there's music and sound effects also playing, this feature enhances the dialog in a way that makes it much clearer, so it's easier to hear and understand. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar connects to a TV via an HDMI or optical audio cable. While the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar might look like every other soundbar from the outside, this one has proprietary Bose technology on the inside that will immediately and dramatically enhance someone's TV viewing experience, regardless of what they're watching. \n\n                  $899\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $899\n            at\n      Walmart\n      \n\n\n\n For the person who's constantly losing things: Apple AirTags \n\n\n            \n                Walmart\n\n                          \nIf you know an Apple user who is constantly forgetting where they left their wallet, purse, TV remote, eyeglass case, keys or just about any other item, an Apple AirTag is the perfect stocking stuffer. These small Bluetooth trackers are 1.6-inches wide and 0.31-inches thick and can be inserted into a purse, backpack, eyeglass case, wallet, or luggage. There are also optional AirTag holders that make it easy to attach an AirTag with various other items. When an item that the AirTag is associated with gets misplaced, an iPhone can be used to track it if it's within close proximity. Or, the AirTag can send an alert to your iPhone if someone accidentally leaves an item with the AirTag behind.\u00a0 \n\n\nHowever, where this tracker really comes in handy is when it's placed in Lost Mode. When this happens, Apple is able to use the global network of iPhone users to help someone locate their missing item (and AirTag). This happens automatically, anonymously and in the background.\u00a0 When any other iPhone user comes into close proximity to the lost item (linked with the AirTag), the item owner's phone receives a message containing it's exact location. However, if someone discovers the lost item and taps their iPhone to the AirTag, the person who found the item can receive a message that displays the item owner's contact information, so it can be returned. AirTags are not GPS trackers. These small devices rely on Bluetooth. However, they work well if the missing item is still in close proximity or in areas that are heavily populated with other iPhone users (of which there are 1.46 billion+ of them around the world).\u00a0 \n\n                  $25 (1-Pack)\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $79 (4-Pack)\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n Give someone animated art or share a favorite video clip: Infinite Objects \n\n\n            \n                Infinite Objects\n\n                          \nDigital picture frames are nothing new, but what Infinite Objects offers is something truly unique. It's the ideal gift for someone who likes tech, but is difficult to shop for. Instead of displaying a series still digital images, these contemporary looking acrylic frames can either continuously display an animated piece of art that you pre-select, or a favorite video clip. This content gets permanently loaded into the frame, so there's no internet connection necessary. Simply turn on the frame and it displays the video clip or artwork that's been installed into it.\u00a0 The Infinite Object frames are definitely conversation starters. The person you give it to will never get bored looking at it. These frames make an excellent piece of decor for a desk, nightstand, bookcase, or when it's hung on a wall. Choose between a five-, seven-, or 10-inch frame in acrylic, or a five- or seven-inch frame in bamboo. When placing your order, you can upload your own video clip that's up to 30 minutes in length and at least 1,024 x 576 pixel resolution (in MP4 or MOV format).\u00a0 \n\n\nInstead of your own video, Infinite Objects offers hundreds of visually interesting animated artworks to choose from. Or, if the frame's recipient owns an NTF, that piece of digital art can be printed to the frame. Pricing starts at $79 and goes up to $450 for the larger size frame that displays a piece limited edition animated artwork. \n\n                  $79 and Up\n            at\n      Infinite Objects\n      \n  For the movie fan: Nanoleaf 4D screen mirror and light strip \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Nanoleaf\n\n                          \nThis smart lighting system, equipped with a camera, syncs with your TV to display immersive, dynamic colors. Over 50 LEDs create stunning visual effects across ten separate zones per meter, thanks to a tiny camera that optimizes real-time color selection. \n\n\nThe LEDs, which can accurately display more than 16 million colors, are integrated into a light strip that comes in two sizes -\u2013 one for TVs up to 65 inches, and the other for TVs up to 85 inches. Either light strip can be trimmed to fit perfectly behind the TV it's being used with. And when someone isn't watching TV, the lights are adjustable using the Nanoleaf mobile or desktop app, voice commands, or the included remote control.\u00a0 Choose from four screen mirror modes when watching TV, movies, sports or gaming to control light immersion. Sync with music for a fun audio-visual light show. With a 25,000+ hour lifetime, this gift promises years of enjoyment. Plus, you can expand it with Nanoleaf's other smart lighting systems for seamless synchronization. \n\n\nThere are many LED smart light strips on the market, but this one easily mounts to any TV, is made from quality components, and can create an immersive viewing experience that's visually stunning. The whole setup is also very easy to operate and offers a wide range of ways it can be used beyond when just watching TV. \n\n                  $120\n            at\n      Nanoleaf\n      \n For the techie who can't cook: Brava smart oven starter set\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Brava\n\n                          \nPreparing restaurant quality meals can be a hassle, especially if the person in charge doesn't know how to cook. That's where smart technology comes in. The Brava smart oven has all sorts of technology that helps makes preparing elaborate meals incredibly simple. This device is not your run-of-the-mill convection oven. It's actually 10 devices packed into one countertop unit. \n\n\nThe Brava smart oven can serve as a traditional convection oven, air fryer, toaster, slow cooker, reheater, dehydrator, rice cooker and more. It also roasts and bakes. And best of all, you don't need to know anything about cooking, baking or technology to prepare incredibly tasty meals using your own groceries. There's no meal subscription plan to sign up for. The \"smart\" aspect of this device has more than 7,000 customizable cooking programs that are quickly searchable and selectable using the mobile app. The oven is able to perfectly prepare three core ingredients (including a protein and vegetables) at the same time, with no need to flip or rotate food as it's cooking. The Brava smart oven revolutionizes cooking by preparing meals 2 to 4 times faster than traditional methods and ensuring perfect results with technology. Just choose a recipe, place raw, frozen, or pre-cooked ingredients on a tray, press a button, and let the oven handle the rest. It notifies you when your meal is ready via smartphone. This versatile oven can cook various dishes, making meal options limitless, and cleanup is a breeze. \n\n\nThe Brava smart oven is ideal for someone who lives alone or for a couple that needs to prepare enough food for a single meal, without generating waste or having to store leftovers. It's incredibly simple to use, and the types of meals, snacks and desserts this smart oven can prepare is practically limitless.\u00a0 \n\n                  $1,295\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n For the frequent traveler: Allocacoc Power Cube \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Walmart\n\n                          \nAnyone who travels a lot or works remotely from hotels, airports or coffeeshops knows that finding enough power outlets to keep a laptop computer and multiple mobile devices charged can be a huge challenge.\u00a0 \n\n\nThat's where the Power Cube comes in handy. This 2.25 by 2.52 inch cube contains four power outlets and two USB Type-A ports, a surge protector and a 10-foot cable that plugs into a single electrical outlet. This makes it compact enough to travel with, but versatile enough to provide multiple power outlets when and where they're needed. This truly is a \"must have\" tool for frequent travelers. And at just $35, it's more on the affordable side too.\u00a0 Why we choose it: Power Cube is easier to carry around than a traditional power strip and extension cord.\u00a0 \n\n                  $25\n            at\n      Walmart\n      \nThere's also a similar version of the\u00a0Power Cube\u00a0that's configured with five outlets and a 4.9-foot power cable (but no USB ports). \n\n                  $14\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For the coffee lover: Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDo you know someone who loves coffee and spends a fortune at Starbucks or their favorite coffee shop? Well, here's a smart coffee maker that allows someone to enjoy a really good cup of coffee that's custom made to their personal taste and specifications. The Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the ideal gift for lovers of the morning joe. It works with any of Keurig's K-Cups and has an integrated milk frother, allowing it to prepare coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, hot cocoa or tea. Users can also choose between preparing hot beverages or brewing them over ice. What makes this a \"smart\" coffee maker? Well, it runs using a mobile app and immediately identifies whatever K-Cup is inserted into it. The coffee maker then adjusts its internal settings accordingly to bring out the flavor of the K-Cup's contents. Using MultiStream technology, for each beverage, it's possible to select the strength of the brew, as the coffee maker saturates the coffee grounds to extract the full flavor and aroma. \n\n\nUsers can select their mug/cup size (between 2 or 4-ounce coffee shots, or a 6, 8, 10 or 12-ounce cup). This countertop coffee maker can prepare a wide range of specialty drinks and even keeps track of a home's K-Cup inventory. When a specific flavor or variety is running low, the machine will automatically order more K-Cups (at a discount), so nobody in the household ever runs out of their favorite flavor or blend. Perhaps the biggest perk of the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the time and money it saves compared to constantly going to your favorite cafes.\u00a0 From a technology standpoint, we found the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker to be easy to use. It offers a huge variety of hot and cold beverages options. It also gives users multiple options to customize their favorite drinks. \n\n                  $183\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For the avid reader and notetaker: reMarkable Paper Pro\n\n\n            \n                reMarkable\n\n                          \nThe first thing someone typically notices when removing the reMarkable Paper Pro from its packaging are just how lightweight and thin the device is. Yet, this digotal notepad provides an impressively large, 11.8 inch color digital ink display that's glare-free. The stylus connects to the e-reader using a magnet and quickly recharges while it's connected.\u00a0The Paper Pro's display is more responsive and smooth than what we've seen from competing full-color digital ink displays. It relies on E Ink Gallery 3 technology and is able to showcase more accurate colors than many other full-color e-readers, without causing eye strain that is common with many LED and LCD displays found in tablets and laptops. The handwriting experience is very similar in feel to writing on paper using a pen thanks to the screen's texture and the design of the stylus. Yet, you can change the color, style and thickness of the virtual link with a few on-screen taps.\n\n\nAs an e-reader, any e-books available in either the industry-standard ePub or PDF file formats work fine with this device. However, if you want to be able to customize the size of the text and choose the font an e-book is displayed in, choose e-books in the ePub file format. Any PDF documents viewed on the Paper Pro (as with any device) retain the format and appearance they were created with.Compared to other digital notepads that also serve as e-readers, this model has a more intuitive interface that runs using reMarkable's proprietary operating system. As an e-reader, the device lacks some of the functionality you'd get from an Amazon Kindle. It's not waterproof, nor is it designed to play audiobooks or podcasts. Much more emphasis has been put on note-taking and digital notepad functionality, as well as viewing and being able to annotate full-color PDF documents and files.\n\n\nWe're huge fans of the Paper Pro's design and overall performance, but instead of having an online e-book store of its own, you'll need to find and acquire your e-books from independent sources, such as\u00a0ebooks.com\u00a0or\u00a0BAM! Books-A-Million e-book store. As a note-taking tool and digital notepad, this is hands-down the best we've seen.\n\n                  $629 (with Marker Plus stylus)\n            at\n      Best Buy\n      \n\n\n                  $579 (with basic stylus)\n            at\n      reMarkable\n      \n For the aspiring writer: Freewrite Traveler \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIs there someone you know who dreams of becoming a book author? Well, if they have trouble staying focused when they sit down to write on their desktop or laptop computer, because they constantly get bombarded by alerts, alarms, notifications, incoming emails and the urge to check their social media account, then the Freewrite Traveler is the dedicated digital writing tool they need. \n\n\nThis is a portable digital typewriter and that's it. It allows someone to focus exclusively on their writing, with no digital distractions. In fact, the Freewrite Traveler does not even use a full-featured word processor, so there are no restrictions related to formatting text or worrying about spelling and grammar checkers (until the editing process). The purpose of this portable device is to allow someone to simply focus on their writing and allow their creativity to flow freely.\u00a0 As documents are created, they automatically sync with a cloud-based service (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Evernote), so they can be viewed, edited, printed or shared on a computer using any full featured word processor or text editor. Like popular e-readers, the Freewrite Traveler relies on an e-ink display that can be easily seen in bright light (including sunlight) or in a dark room. The screen does not cause eye fatigue and is virtually glare-free. The full-size keyboard uses responsive scissor switch keys, which makes typing smooth, more accurate and comfortable. And because the device is small (about half the size of a traditional laptop computer), lightweight (1.6 pounds) and its battery lasts up to four weeks, someone can get their writing done virtually anywhere.\u00a0 \n\n\nThe Freewrite Traveler is a great gift for accomplished or aspiring novelists, poets and authors who want a comfortable and distraction-free writing experience they can use whenever inspiration comes to them. Who knows, someone who receives this as a gift might be so grateful, they dedicate their next novel to you. \n\n                  $529\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n For nostalgic music lovers: Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive premium turntable\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIn the past few years, record players and turntables that play vinyl records have had a resurgence in popularity, so if your husband has a record collection from his earlier years stored in the attic or basement, giving him a premium turntable will allow him to reconnect with the unique sound quality of records (compared to streaming audio).\u00a0\n\n\nFor someone who already has a sound system in place, the Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive turntable offers a high-end way for your husband to enjoy his favorite vinyl albums in a way that captures the warmth of analog music. This turntable not only looks beautiful, it makes 33 \u2153 and 45 RPM sound fantastic. Using a floating motor, it deadens vibrations and distortions in a way that brings out an album's authentic stereo sound.\u00a0For more than 50 years, Marantz has manufactured high-end audio equipment. This turntable taps into those decades of expertise, yet uses modern technology and a contemporary design aesthetic to provide a nostalgic vinyl album listening experience your husband will truly appreciate.\n\n                  $1,799\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For carrying a laptop computer: Timbuk2 Custom messenger bag \n\n\n\n\n            \n                TimBuk2\n\n                          \nTimBuk2 is a San Francisco-based company that makes high-quality messenger bags, luggage and backpacks that are durable and come in a wide range of sizes and color combinations. However, instead of choosing a pre-made bag to give to someone as a gift (which you can certainly do), the Timbuk2 website has a bag design tool that allows anyone with a computer to custom-design their own messenger bag\u2013-which will then be created and sent to their home within days. To give a custom messenger bag to someone as a gift, get them a digital gift card from the TimBuk2 website for $150 (or more). The recipient will be able to redeem that gift card online and then choose the style, colors and accessories incorporated into their custom bag. For example, a padded laptop sleeve can be added to a messenger bag, along with a drink holder pocket and an upgraded padded shoulder strap.\u00a0 \n\n\nNot only are the TikBuk2 bags functional and versatile, they're also well made and designed to last for years. Even the smaller size messenger bags can hold a laptop computer in a padded compartment, while keeping other belongings well organized and easily accessible. Plus, someone can have as much fun designing their own bag as they will using it during their day-to-day adventures. \n\n                  $100 and up\n            at\n      Timbuk2\n      \n For showcasing digital photos: Skylight frame\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDo you know someone who is not at all tech savvy and who isn't active on social media, like your mother-in-law or grandmother?

Once it's connected to a home's Wi-Fi, anyone who is invited to can email the frame photos or video clips, from anywhere in the world, using their smartphone, tablet or computer. The frame actually comes with its own unique email address which makes sending content to it as easy as sending an email. Once delivered, the frame starts displaying the images within a minute or two and then adds the new images to its constantly playing digital slideshow. \n\n\nThe Skylight frame offers a 10-inch, high-resolution (1,2080 x 800 pixel) touchscreen display and has enough internal storage to hold more than 8,000 images. The frame surrounding the screen comes in black, silver, white or gold. From the settings menu, the frame can be set to an always on mode, or follow a predetermined schedule to automatically turn itself on and off. One handy feature is the frame's \"gift mode.\" It allows for someone to remotely pre-configure the frame and deliver initial photos to it, so all the recipient needs to do is take it out of the box and plug it in. Then, as photos or video clips are displayed, someone can swipe forwards or backwards to scroll through the stored images. Otherwise, they'll be displayed as part of an animated slideshow at the speed the user selects. One other great thing about this digital frame is that there's no ongoing subscription associated with it. Please note that the area where the frame is placed must have a continuous Internet connection via Wi-Fi to be able to receive images. \n\n\nThe Skylight frame can be pre-configured remotely. Invited friends and family can then email photos directly to the frame. \n\n                  $140\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $130\n            at\n      Skylight\n      \n For the wellness fan: The Oura ring \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Oura\n\n                          \nMany smartphones and smartwatches come equipped with sensors to monitor various aspects of health, such as sleep patterns, stress levels and daily activity. However, these devices can be bulky and not always convenient to carry. Enter the Oura ring, a stylish 24/7 health tracker worn on your finger. It can monitor sleep, workouts, menstrual cycles, and more, with a battery life of up to a week and easy recharging using the provided charger. \n\n\nOnce users select their ring size and design on the Oura website, they receive their ring, which can be set up in minutes through the Oura mobile app. This ring keeps tabs on heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2) levels, activity, stress, and sleep patterns. It securely and wirelessly transfers this data to the user's smartphone for analysis and storage. The Oura app, available on iOS, Android, and Apple Watch, provides insights into health, fitness, and sleep patterns, allowing users to track their progress and check various results based on their chosen metrics.\u00a0 Users can share data with Apple Health, Google Fit, and various other health and fitness apps for comprehensive analysis and insights. We love the Oura ring not only for its style and color options but also for its user-friendliness and comfort, weighing less than most traditional jewelry. To fully utilize the Oura ring, users will need an ongoing $5.99 per month subscription.The Oura ring can comfortably be worn 24/7, including in the shower, bathtub, or while swimming. It's available in two styles and a variety of colors. This is a great gift for someone who has trouble sleeping or who wants (or needs) to keep better tabs on their health and activity level. It's much more convenient to use than similar functionality that's offered by a smartwatch or activity tracker, because it can unobtrusively be worn all day and night on a finger.\n\n\nIf the person you're shopping for is a Samsung Galaxy smartphone user (or Android phone user for that matter), we recommend checking out the\u00a0Galaxy Ring\u00a0($400). It too offers a comprehensive collection of health, fitness tracking, sleep management and stress monitoring tools.\n\n                  $299 and up\n            at\n      Oura\n      \n For the adventurer: GoPro Hero 13 Black action camera \n\n\n\n\n            \n                GoPro\n\n                          \nWith all of the new advancements in the GoPro Hero 13 Black compact camera, referring to it as just an action camera is a misnomer. Yes, the GoPro Hero 13 Black is small, lightweight, waterproof, temperature-proof and durable -- all of the key features someone could want from an action camera. There are also dozens of mounts, mods and accessories that allow you to attach the camera to your body or equipment so you can capture content from a stunning, first-person perspective.\n\n\nHowever, this GoPro camera is an easy-to-use, point-and-shoot still image and broadcast-quality video camera, too, so it can also be used as an everyday point-and-shoot camera, vacation camera, vlogging camera and more, even if you're a total amateur. It also works as a webcam or live streaming camera.The GoPro Hero 13 Pro can capture still images at 27MP resolution. It can also capture video at up to 5.3K (60fps) resolution using a variety of shooting modes, lenses and field-of-view options. The image stabilization built into the camera is better than ever, as is its low-light and nighttime shooting capabilities. There's even a new 400fps slow-motion feature.\n\n\nThe most exciting additions to this year's model are the interchangeable, HB-Series lenses. To keep things super-simple, regardless of which lens you attach, it automatically identifies the lens and adjusts the camera's settings.\u00a0Available lenses include a macro lens mod, ultra wide lens mod, and a Smart Motion Blur ND filter 4-pack. Plus, an anamorphic lens mod will be released in early-2025. It will allow you to capture undistorted, 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio with lens flares when shooting video.\n\n\nOther notable enhancements include extended battery life for GoPro's Enduro interchangeable and rechargeable batteries. There's also a new magnetic door and power cable kit that makes it easier to keep the camera going using an external power source. Plus, GoPro has made some tweaks to the camera's mounting system. It now offers an optional magnetic mount add-on that makes it easy to attach and detach the camera from various stands, tripods and mounts in mere seconds, without having to tinker with a thumbscrew.Everything people love about the GoPro cameras continues to be offered by the GoPro Hero 13 Black, including the re-introduction of a GPS feature that tracks the time, date, location, speed and altitude of what you shoot. You can now use more voice commands to control the camera and pair it with Apple AirPods, any Bluetooth earbuds, or wireless microphones to capture narration or specialized audio. The new voice mode automatically prioritizes voice audio when recording video and eliminates unwanted ambient sounds. This is particularly useful to vloggers and live streamers.\n\n\nAnd best of all, when the camera is set on easy mode, it becomes an idiot-proof point-and-shoot camera that's ready for anything. So just about anyone can capture great content without having to tinker with complex settings. Pros can switch to advance mode and get manual control over the camera's many settings and features.The GoPro Hero 13 Black camera comes with one Enduro battery, USB cable, a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle and a thumb screw.

Even better, it can go from a laptop stand for use when sitting at a table or desk, to a stand that can be used from that flat surface while standing up. The Moft-Z unfolds and is ready to use in less than 15 seconds. It's available in four colors and has a weight capacity of 22 pounds. This is more than enough to safely hold any laptop computer. The design of the Moft-Z is brilliantly simple to use, yet complex in its design. It makes remote working much more comfortable. \n\n\nMeanwhile, if the person you're shopping for doesn't need the stand-up option built into the stand, the Moft Invisible Slip Laptop Stand ($24.99) uses adhesive to attach to the bottom of any laptop computer and then quickly unfolds to position the computer at the ideal typing and viewing angle -- either 15- or 25-degrees. This unit weighs just three ounces. The material uses is a mere 2.82mm thick. This version of the stand accommodates laptop computers up to 16-inches wide and that weigh up to 11 pounds. This is a wonderful and unique gift for someone who works remotely using a laptop computer It provides a more comfortable (and ergonomic) typing and viewing position.

It's possible to adjust the light's arm to change its height, move around the circular LED light to a specific angle, and adjust the brightness and color temperature of the light itself. Light temperature can be adjusted between 2700K ad 7500K, while brightness can be adjusted from zero up to 700 lumens. Light emanates from a circular LED with a six-inch diameter. The weighted base keeps it firmly in place. \n\n\nPerhaps the best use of this desk lamp, thanks to its adjustability, is as a replacement for a ring light when participating in a video call or virtual meeting. When positioned toward someone's face while they're sitting at a desk, the Edge Light provides even lighting. We love the overall design and versatility of the Lumecube Edge Light 2.0 Base Edition because it offers so many adjustment options.

Some communities, like those in and around the Tampa Bay area, were still reeling from the impacts of Hurricane Helene less than two weeks ago.\"Fluctuations in intensity are likely while Milton moves across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Milton is expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the west-central coast of Florida Wednesday night.\" the National Hurricane Center said.\u00a0CBS News Meteorologist Nikki Nolan, the latest forecast track shows Milton making landfall over Sarasota, Florida, sometime overnight Wednesday and into Thursday because it has slowed.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the most recent models have it somewhere in Manatee County, just south of Tampa Bay,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a briefing Tuesday. \"But I would just tell people, one, we're going to have impacts far beyond wherever the eye of the storm is. Two, you can make landfall anywhere from Citrus County down into Southwest Florida. We'll know more over the next 12 to 18 hours. But just, cones, all this stuff you see, the impacts will be broader than that, specifically with respect to storm surge.\"The National Weather Service in Tampa Bay described Milton as \"a historic storm for the west coast of Florida\" that could prove to be the worst storm to impact Tampa Bay in more than 100 years.\nA message is seen outside an apartment in the Davis Islands community of Tampa, Florida, as residents prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Milton, Oct. 8, 2024.\n\n            \n                AP Photo/Julio Cortez\n\n                          \nFloridians in the potential path of the hurricane lined properties with sandbags, boarded up doors and windows, and moved their boats ahead of the storm's arrival. DeSantis issued emergency orders over the weekend that now include 51 counties, whose residents, he said, should prepare for power outages, stock up on enough food and water to last a week and be ready to leave their homes if necessary.\n\n\nThe hurricane center said Tuesday evening that Milton posed \"an extremely life-threatening situation\" to those in the storm surge warning area of the west-central coast of Florida, and \"you should evacuate today if ordered by local officials. There will likely not be enough time to wait to leave on Wednesday.\"A storm surge warning was in effect from the Sebastian Inlet in Florida, north to Altamaha Sound, Georgia.\u00a0Once it makes landfall, Milton was forecast to remain a hurricane as it crosses the Florida peninsula, the hurricane center said.\u00a0\"Preparations to protect life and property, including being ready for long-duration power outages, should be completed tonight.\"\n\n\nIt was expected to move off Florida's east coast and into the Atlantic Ocean sometime Thursday.\u00a0 \u00a0Tracking Hurricane MiltonMilton on Tuesday was traveling just north of Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, where the Mexican government issued hurricane warnings as forecasters expected damaging winds and a life-threatening storm surge to hit portions of the coast. The hurricane had weakened somewhat since its maximum sustained wind speeds swirled past 180 mph Monday during a rapid period of intensification that the National Hurricane Center called \"explosive\" and \"remarkable.\"Milton had\u00a0dropped back down\u00a0to Category 4 overnight Monday. But by Tuesday evening, the storm churned over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with maximum wind speeds hovering around 165 mph \u2014 which is above the 157 mph threshold for a Category 5 storm. Forecasters said they expected Milton to retain its status as a major hurricane on its way to the western Florida coast. \u00a0As of Tuesday evening, Milton was located 320 miles southwest of the Dry Tortugas, Florida, and 480 miles southwest of Tampa. It was moving northeast at 9 mph.\u00a0A hurricane warning was in effect for the Florida west coast from Bonita Beach north to Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay, and the state's east coast from the St. Lucie-Martin County line north to Ponte Vedra Beach.\u00a0Multiple areas were also under tropical storm watches and warnings, including portions of Georgia, South Carolina and the Bahamas. That peak strength rivaled the most disastrous Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history and happened at breakneck speed. Milton was a tropical storm only 24 hours before it snowballed into a Category 5 hurricane, the highest ranking on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which rates storms based on their sustained wind speeds.\nA satellite image of Hurricane Milton in the Gulf of Mexico at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Oct. 8, 2024.\u00a0\n\n            \n                NOAA/NESDIS/STAR GOES-East\n\n                          \n\"It is worth emphasizing that this is a very serious situation,\" the hurricane center said Tuesday morning. \"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida.\"\n\n\nTampa Bay braces for landfallThe latest forecasts suggest Milton will make landfall either on or near the Tampa Bay area, likely as a formidable Category 3 hurricane. Although predictions as to Milton's landfall location and timing have oscillated somewhat since Monday, when the storm underwent rapid changes, forecasts have remained fairly steady as far as the hurricane's intensity when it strikes land. Milton's wind speeds at that time are expected to fall to about 125 mph, according to the hurricane center. For impacted places, that could be devastating.\nDebris from homes flooded by Hurricane Helene sits curbside as Hurricane Milton approaches on Oct. 8, 2024, in Port Richey, Florida.\n\n            \n                AP Photo/Mike Carlson\n\n                          \nExactly where the hurricane is centered when Milton arrives on land may determine the extent of the destruction it wreaks on the Tampa Bay area, mainly linked to storm surge,\u00a0wrote CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan.\"The forecast track with Milton has its sights set on the western coast of Florida, but the position of the center of the storm, or the 'eye,' can determine how catastrophic the impacts are on the Tampa Bay area,\" Nolan said. \"The eastern side of the eye is considered the 'dirty side' of the storm, which is where the winds tend to be the strongest. As the forecast track shifts northward, the dirty side then falls over Tampa Bay.\"\n\n\n            \n                CBS Miami\n\n                          \nThat creates more serious risks of storm surge in the region, according to Nolan. Forecasts have warned Milton's arrival could bring potentially life-threatening storm surge to the Florida Gulf Coast, which is particularly vulnerable to severe surges because of its geography, and that is especially true for Tampa Bay. Multiple people died in Tampa from storm surge caused by Hurricane Helene, and that storm did not even hit the city directly.Storm surge forecastHurricane and storm surge warnings expanded Tuesday to include large sections of Florida's eastern coast, which could potentially see surges up to \u00a0feet above ground level as Milton tracks inland over the state after making landfall, on its route toward the Atlantic. Coastal places in Georgia and South Carolina could experience several feet of storm surge too.Storm surge threats are a major concern for the west coast of Florida. In addition to hurricane warnings in place from Bonita Beach northward to the mouth of the Suwannee River, storm surge warnings were also in effect from Flamingo northward to the same location, including Charlotte Harbor and Tampa Bay.\u00a0\nMap shows the forecast for possible storm surge levels from Hurricane Milton.\u00a0\n\n            \n                NOAA/National Hurricane Center\n\n                          \nThe hurricane center has warned that storm surge in the Tampa Bay area could reach 10 to 15 feet above ground level.\n\n\n\"The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the south of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves,\" the hurricane center said in a Monday afternoon advisory. \"Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.\" \u00a0Forecasts show heavy rainfall, up to 15 inches in certain areas, could cause \"considerable flash, urban and areal flooding, along with moderate to major river flooding\" in parts of the Florida peninsula though Thursday.Evacuation zonesMass evacuations were underway as Florida airports canceled flights, and schools as far south as Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties announced closures ahead of Milton's expected arrival. Thousands fled the Tampa Bay area and parts of the surrounding region were under mandatory evacuation orders issued Monday and Tuesday.As tens of thousands flee Milton's path, the Georgia Department of Transportation reported that it saw traffic volumes as of 8 a.m. Tuesday on Interstate 75 that were 280% higher than normal between the Georgia and Florida state line.\u00a0United said Tuesday night that it had added 18 extra flights out of Florida, as well larger aircraft on four of those flights in an effort to serve as many customers as possible. It said all flights out of Tampa, Fort Myers and Sarasota were full through Thursday. Aviation analytics company Circium reported that 80% of flights from Tampa were canceled Tuesday.\u00a0\"We are talking about the possibility now of a direct hit,\" said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor in a CNN interview Monday, where she urged people to heed storm warnings and follow evacuation protocols. Castor noted that storm surge caused by Helene, while destructive, was significantly lower than the surge forecast for a vast stretch of Florida's western coast, including Tampa, with Milton.\nHeavy traffic flows northbound on Interstate 75 as people evacuate the Tampa Bay area ahead of Hurricane Milton's arrival Oct. 7, 2024, in Ocala, Florida.\n\n            \n                AP Photo/Julio Cortez\n\n                          \n\"Helene was a wake-up call. This is literally catastrophic. And I can say, without any dramatization whatsoever, if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die,\" Castor said.\n\n\nPresident Biden echoed the mayor Tuesday morning as the White House announced he would postpone a trip to Germany and Angola to monitor the response to Hurricane Milton.\"I've urged everyone, everyone currently located in Hurricane Milton's path to listen to local officials and follow safety instructions,\" Mr. Biden said. \"... If you're under evacuation orders, you should evacuate now, now, now \u2014 you should have already evacuated. It's a matter of life and death.\"Mr. Biden said he preapproved emergency declarations in Florida and sent Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell to the state Monday. The president also said he has spoken to all political leaders in the region expected to feel Milton's impacts and told them, \"Anything they ask for, they can get.\"Hurricane Milton live radar mapThis radar loop from CBS Miami shows weather conditions over Florida and the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Milton approaches. \u00a0   CBS Miami \n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tropical Storm Milton named, could be Florida's 2nd major hurricane in 2 weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cooler, drier air arrives Monday in North Texas; Milton intensifies in the Gulf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n North Texas volunteers prep to help with Hurricane Milton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Calm, clear days ahead for North Texas as Hurricane Milton intensifies in the Gulf\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Gulf of Mexico\nFlorida\nHurricane\nNational Hurricane Center\n\nEmily Mae Czachor\n\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

He was arrested Monday in Oklahoma City, and the Justice Department said he was making his initial appearance in federal court on Tuesday.According to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday, Tawhedi and unnamed co-conspirators \u2014 including a juvenile who is Tawhedi's brother-in-law \u2014 were followers of ISIS and took steps to carry out their attack in the U.S., including by trying to sell their family home, relocate their families abroad and purchase firearms and ammunition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their ultimate aim was to stage a violent attack in the United States in the name of and on behalf of ISIS,\" prosecutors wrote.\u00a0Twenty-seven-year-old Tawhedi traveled to the U.S. on a Special Immigrant Visa in September 2021, days after the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, and the criminal complaint said he is \"currently on parole status pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings.\" The U.S. offers Special Immigrant Visas to individuals who worked with the U.S. armed forces or under chief of mission authority as a translator or interpreter in either Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the State Department.\n\n\nElectronic records accessed by the FBI showed Tawhedi allegedly viewed ISIS propaganda and contributed about $540 in cryptocurrency to a charity in Syria \"which fronts for and funnels money to ISIS.\"\u00a0 \u00a0Federal investigators allege Tawhedi searched for access to surveillance and security cameras in Washington, D.C., and checked webcams showing the White House and Washington Monument in late July. They also believe Tawhedi was seeking out places in which gun laws were more lax.\u00a0Federal investigators said they sent a confidential human source and later an undercover FBI agent to secretly interact with the men as they sought to sell their home and other possessions on Facebook and purchase weapons.In a Sept. 21 message to a person allegedly associated with terrorist activity, Tawhedi said he had purchased two kalashnikov rifles and ordered 500 bullets.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What do you think, brother? Is it enough or should we increase it,\" the Telegram message said.\u00a0In subsequent messages, Tawhedi said his father-in-law's house had sold for $185,000, and they would receive the funds by Oct. 15. He also asked for help in resettling his family, which included his mother-in-law, wife, their young daughter and five of his wife's siblings, in Afghanistan. Tawhedi purchased one-way plane tickets for the family to travel to Kabul on Oct. 17.\u00a0\"After that we will begin our duty, God willing, with the help of God, we will get ready for the election day,\" Tawhedi wrote.\u00a0According to the criminal complaint, Tawhedi and his brother-in-law received two AK-47 rifles on Monday, shortly before their arrest.Tawhedi told investigators during a post-arrest interview that they had purchased the weapons to carry out an attack on Election Day and target large gatherings of people, during which they \"expected to be martyred,\" the complaint says.\u00a0In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was \"proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed.\"\u00a0Attorney General Merrick Garland said, \"We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to America's national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people.\"\n\n\nNational security and intelligence officials have for months warned of a more complex and dangerous threat landscape.

VanDerStok, isn't whether Second Amendment rights were violated, but whether the ATF exceeded its authority when it issued the regulation in 2022. The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational firearm, and the incomplete frame of a handgun and receiver of a rifle.\n\n\nThe measure aims to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made from 3D printers or kits and parts available online. Because these firearms don't have serial numbers or transfer records, it's difficult for law enforcement to trace them to their buyers, making them especially attractive to people who can't legally buy firearms or plan to use them in crimes.\nGhost guns are displayed at the headquarters of the San Francisco Police Department on Nov. 27, 2019.\n\n            \n                Haven Daley / AP\n\n                          \nBut by clarifying the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act to cover these kits, the manufacturers and sellers of ghost guns must adhere to the same requirements that commercial gun makers do.A group of 20 major cities told the Supreme Court in a filing that the rule appears to have been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities and around the country. In New York, for example, ghost gun recoveries dropped last year for the first time in four years. In Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argues before the Supreme Court on behalf of the government, reiterated that the rule has helped curb the surge in crimes committed using ghost guns. The market for the firearms \"essentially collapsed\" after the rule took effect, she told the justices, underscoring that they were sold to be \"crime guns.\"\n\n\nThe Supreme Court argumentsEarly in the arguments, Justice Samuel Alito questioned the Biden administration's interpretation that a parts kit can be readily converted into a weapon that is regulated as a firearm. Could a pen and pad of paper become a grocery list, he asked, or is a group of eggs, ham, peppers and onions a Western Omelet?Prelogar said no, and stressed that those items have other uses. But in the case of kits used to assemble ghost guns, they are designed and intended to construct firearms, she said.The analogy quickly was picked up by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose vote in the case could be pivotal. She asked Prelogar if her response would change if a consumer ordered a meal kit from a company like HelloFresh that contained all the ingredients for the purpose of cooking an omelet. The solicitor general said Barrett's is a \"more apt analogy,\" since they are not scattered components.Prelogar told the court that she has experience putting a parts kit together, which she said required few steps and tools.Chief Justice John Roberts, another member whose vote will be key, seemed to rebuff claims from the challengers as to the difficulty of assembling a ghost gun from kits. Pete Patterson, who argued for the gun owners and gun rights groups, has said hobbyists interested in building their own firearms often purchase these products, not criminals.But the chief justice said it's \"not terribly difficult\" for someone to complete a frame or receiver, which may require drilling a few holes and removing plastic rails.\"Drilling a hole or two I would think doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,\" he said.\n\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh told Prelogar that her interpretation of the Gun Control Act \"has force,\" but he sought assurances that a kit seller who is unaware they're breaking the law would not be charged if they failed to comply with requirements like stamping their products with serial numbers or obtaining a license.\"This is an agency regulation that broadens a criminal statute beyond what it had been before,\" he said.Prelogar told Kavanaugh that there's protection for manufacturers who seek to comply with the law in good faith.\"ATF is not trying to hide the ball here. The point of the agency is not a game of gotcha to try to criminally prosecute people. There was a very serious public safety threat posed by the explosion of the use of these ghost guns in crimes, and so the whole point of this regulation is simply to put the regulated industry on notice,\" she said.The challenge to the ghost gun ruleThe gun owners, advocacy groups and kit manufacturers brought their lawsuit against the Biden administration over the rule shortly after it took effect. They argued that when Congress wrote the 1968 gun law, it didn't give the ATF the power to change the definition of firearm to cover kits. A federal district court judge invalidated the regulation. A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit also struck it down, finding that only finished firearms, or complete frames or receivers, are covered by the Gun Control Act.The Biden administration then asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, arguing that the rule just ensures that ghost guns comply with the same requirements that apply to commercial firearms sales. Prelogar told the Supreme Court those requirements are \"crucial\" for solving gun crimes and keeping firearms out of the hands of minors, felons and domestic abusers.Untraceable ghost guns, she said, are \"attractive\" to people who can't lawfully purchase a gun, and Prelogar lamented that the nation has seen an \"explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns\" since these kits became available.\n\n\nThe 5th Circuit's decision, Prelogar wrote in a filing, \"ignores the words Congress wrote and would effectively nullify the act's careful regulatory scheme by allowing anyone to anonymously buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes \u2014 no background check, records, or serial number required.\"She also argued that the lower court's interpretation of the law frustrates its design by transforming the definition of firearm into an invitation to evade its requirements.\"All guns could become ghost guns\" if the 5th Circuit's decision stands, Prelogar said.But the challengers said the ATF's clarification cannot be reconciled with the plain text of the Gun Control Act and risks upending the regulation of semi-automatic guns. Patterson told the justices that the ATF has exceeded its authority by \"operating outside the bounds set by Congress,\" and expanding the definition of frame or receiver, as well as firearm through its rule.The gun owners and manufacturers said in filing that any change in the regulatory approach to privately made firearms must come from Congress, not the ATF.\"The decisive fact in this case is Congress's decision, in the GCA, to focus on the commercial firearm market rather than the private making of firearms for personal use. Accordingly, the GCA does not reach the items used in private firearm making that ATF attempts to regulate,\" the gun owners, led by Jennifer VanDerStok of Texas, said.The Supreme Court has been asked to intervene in the legal dispute before, but in an earlier stage in the litigation. In August 2023, the high court agreed to allow the Biden administration to enforce the ghost gun rule until it issues a decision on its legality, likely by the end of June 2025.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Supreme Court divided 5-4 in halting the district court order that struck down the measure, with Roberts and Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.Roberts and Barrett's earlier votes make them key justices to watch, though they do not mean they'll vote to uphold the measure now that the Supreme Court is considering the merits of the case.The high court will consider the ghost gun rule just months after it invalidated a separate measure that banned bump stocks, a firearms accessory that increases a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire to hundreds of rounds per minute.\u00a0In striking down the rule, the Supreme Court's six-justice conservative majority ruled the ATF exceeded its authority when it issued the ban in 2018 after a mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas, the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court probes limits of ATF rule regulating ghost guns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court won't decide Texas dispute over emergency abortions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court won't hear dispute involving Jack Smith and Trump's X data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court to weigh legality of Biden administration's ghost guns rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court allows EPA to enforce methane rule for oil, gas facilities for now\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \n\nMelissa Quinn\n\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians,\" she said at the September presidential debate. \"But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.\"\u00a0Harris has not laid out a plan for a two-state solution.\u00a0Earlier this year she called on the Israeli government to do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Harris' national security adviser said in August that the Democratic nominee does not support an arms embargo on Israel. Harris said in September she supported Mr. Biden's decision in May to withhold a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs from Israel amid concerns that they'd be used in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians were sheltering after fleeing their homes.In an interview that aired Monday on \"60 Minutes,\" Harris was asked whether the U.S. can consider Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a close ally, in the face of his resistance to a cease-fire and his bombing of Lebanon to target Hezbollah, though the U.S. has cautioned Israel against igniting a wider war with its northern neighbor.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I think, with all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes,\" Harris said.\u00a0Trump has claimed that the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas would have never happened if he were president. But the former president, who has portrayed himself as a staunch defender of Israel, has criticized the Israeli government's handling of the war. In November, he said \"Israel has to do a better job of public relations, frankly, because the other side is beating them at the public relations front.\" He also called on Israel to \"get it over with.\"\u00a0Trump was asked during the June presidential debate whether he would support an independent Palestinian state, to which he responded, \"I'd have to see.\"\u00a0As president, Trump controversially moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and ended decades of U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. (The Biden administration reversed the settlement decision.)\u00a0IranIn the \"60 Minutes\" interview,\u00a0 Harris was asked which country she considers to be the greatest adversary of the U.S.\u00a0\"I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran,\" she said. \"Iran has American blood on their hands.\"She added that it's one of her \"highest priorities\" to ensure that Iran \"never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power.\" Harris did not answer whether the U.S. would take military action if there was proof Iran was building a nuclear weapon.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's unclear whether Harris would seek to cut a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. During the 2020 campaign, Harris, who was running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, said she would seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement, \"so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.\"Trump has been highly critical of the Obama-era deal, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and removed the U.S. from the international agreement in 2018. He called the 2015 agreement \"disastrous\" and \"a great embarrassment.\"\u00a0After Iran's missile attack on Israel last week, Harris called Iran a \"destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East\" and said she supported Mr. Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel.\u00a0\"Iran is not only a threat to Israel, Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the ends of Iran-backed and based terrorist proxies,\" she said. \"We will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend U.S. forces and interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists and we'll continue to work with our allies and partners to disrupt Iran's aggressive behavior and hold them accountable.\"\u00a0Trump shared a similar sentiment, accusing Iran of \"exporting terror all over the world.\" But he also blamed the Biden administration's leadership for the missile barrage, again making the argument that it would not have happened if he were in the White House.\u00a0He has also suggested that Iran may be connected to the two assassination attempts against him. He said the U.S. should threaten to blow the country to \"smithereens\" if it attacked a presidential candidate.\u00a0There is so far no indication from the FBI or Secret Service that Iran was involved in the assassination attempts. However, Iran does appear to be a threat to Trump's safety. A Pakistani national with alleged ties to Iran was\u00a0arrested in August and charged with plotting to assassinate current and former government officials across the political spectrum, including Trump, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation.\n\n\nIran is also accused of trying to interfere in the presidential election. The Justice Department recently\u00a0charged three Iranian hackers with allegedly targeting members of Trump's campaign.\u00a0\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska Senate race surprise: It's \"more competitive than it should be\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamala Harris proposes Medicare pay for more in-home health care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris and Trump's positions on Iran and Israel as tensions flare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the music: Latino celebrities and presidential politics in the 2024 election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Trump spending would both boost the U.S. debt.

Since 2000, Asian American and Pacific Islander women of any age have seen the largest uptick, with a 2.5% to 2.7% increase per year. \u00a0CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook says a lot of this rise is in the kinds of breast cancer fueled by estrogen.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What the researchers have noticed is that periods in young girls are starting at an earlier age, and women are tending to delay their first child, so that's more cycles, and more cycles is more surges of estrogen, and potentially that's fueling it,\" LaPook said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\" Tuesday, \"We also have obesity.

These features include notifications that can harm kids' sleep patterns and video autoplay that encourages users to spend more time on the platform, without the option to turn off the autoplay function, according to the complaint.\u00a0\"We strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading.

But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children.The District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \"unlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \"gifts\" to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn't registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok's LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \"virtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation.The 14 attorneys general say the litigation is aimed at stopping TikTok from using these features, imposing financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collecting damages for users who have been harmed.The attorneys general who are suing TikTok include the following states and district:CaliforniaIllinoisKentucky LouisianaMassachusettsMississippiNew JerseyNew YorkNorth Carolina Oregon South Carolina\u00a0VermontWashingtonDistrict of ColumbiaEach attorney general filed a lawsuit in their own jurisdiction.\n\n\nSeparately, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison and 21 other state attorney generals on Tuesday urged a Tennessee court to enforce an order that would require TikTok to comply with a consumer protection investigation.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I get all of my credit card debt forgiven?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Will credit card debt forgiveness cover my $20,000 debt?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How living in extended-stay hotels can affect the health of poor kids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Where to invest in gold as the price rises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here's what a $20,000 HELOC costs monthly now that rates were cut\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Lawsuit\nTikTok\n\nAimee Picchi\n\n\nAimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

Mr. Biden's last visit was nearly a month ago to Westly, Wisconsin for an announcement on providing electricity to rural America.\u00a0\n\n\nThe political focus on Wisconsin by Mr. Biden reflects the hopes that Democrats can hold on to the state that they flipped in 2020 by a slim margin after losing it in 2016.\u00a0Wisconsin is one of six states where lead levels in the blood of children are more than double the national rate, according to a 2021 study published in JAMA pediatrics.\u00a0Even low lead levels can cause small amounts of intellectual impairment depending on the child, according to Dr. Adam Blumenberg, emergency medicine physician and toxicology expert at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\"If there's any amount of concerning lead in the child, you really want to figure out where it's coming from and remove the source of exposure. That's always going to be one of the most important things to do,\" says Blumenberg.\u00a0Deanna Branch, a mother and lead-poisoning awareness activist from Milwaukee, told CBS News that she is finally seeing the money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act being used to remove lead pipes in her community.\u00a0Branch's son Aidan suffered from lead poisoning while they were living in a home with lead in the paint, windows, pipes and soil. Her son's lead levels were so high they had to move out of the home and into a homeless shelter for almost three months while they searched for safe housing. Branch said the experience was terrifying for her son and left him with health issues he will have to face for the rest of his life.\u00a0The Branch's live in a lead paint free home now, but they still have lead pipes.\u00a0\n\n\n\"When I first started advocating there was a 50 year plan that went down to a 40 year plan, now there is a nine year plan to remove all the lead pipes in Milwaukee, Branch tells CBS News. \"I should be alive to see the lead pipes being removed out of Milwaukee and that gives me hope for other places as well.\"\u00a0There is still more the Milwaukee community needs to live in a lead-free safe environment: more housing and more clinics.\u00a0Branch says there is not enough safe housing available in the community. Her old home where her son was lead poisoned was still being rented out as recently as a few years ago according to Branch. As for the Next Door Pediatrics Clinic where her son was first tested for lead positioning, it has since shut down, creating a healthcare gap in the community. Branch credits the work of the clinic for her youngest daughter being lead free.\u00a0There is a sense of shame for parents whose children suffered from lead poisoning, but Branch wants to remove the shame from the equation of asking for help.\u00a0\"I want them to know it's not on you,\" says Branch. \"We're not receiving justice, And it's a human right to have clean drinking water.\" \u00a0\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster relief hurricane loan program precariously low on funds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Biden sends more troops to North Carolina for Hurricane Helene response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data reveals a map of destruction in Gaza from the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Biden postpones overseas trip, urges everyone in Hurricane Milton's path to evacuate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Illegal crossings at U.S. southern border reach new low for Biden era\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Biden Administration\nMilwaukee\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\nPolitics\nWisconsin\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jenna-fischer-the-office-breast-cancer-diagnosis-treatment/", "Title": "\"The Office\" star Jenna Fischer reveals she is cancer-free following treatment", "Author": "Elias Lopez; Editor(s): Elias Lopez", "Date": "October 8, 2024 / 6:29 PM EDT", "content": "Actress Jenna Fischer, known for her role as Pam Beesly in the sitcom \"The Office,\" revealed that she was diagnosed with breast cancer last year but is now cancer-free after receiving treatment.Fischer said in a post on Instagram\u00a0on Tuesday she was diagnosed with Stage 1 triple-positive breast cancer in December of last year after an inconclusive mammogram led to a breast ultrasound.\u00a0\"I never thought I'd be making an announcement like this but here we are.

And it's about dignity for that individual, it's about independence for that individual. People are of declining skills to some extent, but their dignity has not declined, their pride has not declined.\"\u00a0Medicare already covers in-home health care up to 35 hours a week for seniors who are deemed homebound or whose illness deems such help necessary. Seniors who require more than \"intermittent\" care don't qualify, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Harris' proposal would seemingly expand the definition of who qualifies for in-home help, although her campaign hasn't yet elaborated on the details.\u00a0\n\n\nHarris didn't say on the show how much her proposal would cost. She said Medicare would cover the costs by negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, although it's not yet clear if those savings would be sufficient to fund a likely massive expense. The Biden administration has successfully negotiated lower prices for some drugs covered by Medicare with pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0\"There are so many people who are right in the middle. They're taking care of their kids and they're taking care of their aging parents,\" said Harris. She said many Americans have to leave their job and source of income to care for an aging loved one.\u00a0Harris has said the issue is personal for her as she cared for her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, when she was diagnosed with colon cancer nearly two decades ago. She died in 2009.\u00a0Asked to differentiate herself from Mr. Biden, Harris said they're \"different people\" who bring different \"sensibilities\" to the job, mentioning her experience with home health care and focus on small businesses.

Deb Fischer in a race that could shake up the fight for control of Congress' upper chamber.\u00a0Osborn, a Navy veteran, mechanic and union leader, has been garnering millions of dollars in outside support and prompting Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling, albeit limited, indicates a tight race between Fischer and Osborn. A series of recent statewide polls suggest the race is within single digits, including an Independent Center poll released last week that showed Osborn up 47% to Fischer's 42% in a survey of likely voters in the state. An Osborn-commissioned SurveyUSA poll conducted last month found the independent up 45% to Fischer's 44%. And in Nebraska's second congressional district, which is home to Omaha and is the most evenly divided district in the state, a New York Times/Siena poll released late last month showed Osborn leading Fischer by 11 points. There is no Democrat in the race. The surveys suggest the Nebraska Senate race is among the closest in the country, according to 538's polling averages.Republicans have a favorable Senate map this year, with pickup opportunities across a number of states and few seats to defend. And although Nebraska is considered more friendly to Republicans than the two states \u2014 Texas and Florida \u2014 that Democrats have eyed, Osborn's challenge appears to be a formidable one in the unusual race.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It's more competitive than it should be,\" Randall Adkins, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, said of the Nebraska Senate race.\u00a0Osborn led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021, gaining some national attention in the process. But the 49-year-old is a political newcomer. And he's leaned into a populist message to pledge to lead the state as an independent who will work for Nebraskans, while painting his opponent as an establishment politician controlled by corporate interests.The independent candidate touted the polls in a statement to CBS News, saying they \"match up with what I'm seeing across Nebraska.\"\"Our message of standing up for small businesses, family farmers, and working families is resonating because Nebraskans want a senator who listens to them, who shows up for them and who will be a strong voice for them in the Senate,\" Osborn said.\u00a0\nFile: Sen. Deb Fischer speaks as Senate Republicans hold a news conference on Defense Secretary Austin and his health transparency at the US Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 11, 2024.\u00a0\n\n            \n                ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\n\n                          \nOsborn's opponent, Fischer, has been in the Senate for more than a decade and serves on the powerful armed services and appropriations committees. The 73-year-old two-term incumbent who's a reliable GOP vote in the Senate has won relatively easily in the red state and hasn't had a problem raising money, so her race wasn't expected to be a competitive one. Adkins thinks Fischer may have taken her reelection campaign for granted.\n\n\n\"I don't think that the Fisher campaign realized how competitive this race was going to be,\" Adkins said, adding that it was \"radio silence\" from the incumbent all summer, while Osborn was operating \"under the radar.\"\"He was just sort of keeping quiet,\" Adkins said of Osborne. \"And we get to September, and it's within the margin of error.\"The campaign has ramped up in recent weeks. Fischer, a cattle rancher, has touted an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, along with a new advertisement focused on her backing from former Rep. Tom Osborne, long-time coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Osborne clarifies in the advertisement that he doesn't know the independent candidate of a similar name.\u00a0Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has placed $522,000 in advertisement spending and reservations in the race, according to AdImpact.\u00a0The spending comes as Osborn has seen a flood of investments to his campaign. Overall, outside spending supporting the independent has climbed to $4 million, according to OpenSecrets. Much of that comes from the Retire Career Politicians PAC, which receives substantial donations from a left-leaning dark money group known as the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\u00a0The investments underscore that the race could be within striking distance for Osborn.\u00a0Meanwhile, Fischer and Republican allies have derided the independent as a \"Democrat in disguise.\"\n\n\n\"Dan Osborn claims to be an independent, but he's funded by the same billionaire Democrats supporting Kamala Harris, supports mass amnesty and social security for illegal immigrants, and was caught on tape saying he loves Bernie Sanders,\" the Fischer campaign said in a statement to CBS News. \"When Nebraskans learn that Dan Osborn is a liberal Democrat in disguise, they won't stand for it.\" Osborn has pledged not to caucus for either party if he's elected to the Senate, where four independents currently caucus with Democrats. And shortly after the primary, he said he wouldn't accept endorsements from any side of the political spectrum.\"People are coming out of the woodwork now,\" he told reporters in May. \"I want to be clear that I'm an independent. I want to stay true to who I am, and that is an independent. I can't be charmed, I can't be schmoozed, I won't suck up to anyone, and most importantly \u2014 I cannot be bought.\"On the issues, the independent has expressed positions generally shared by moderates \u2014 like opposition to national abortion restrictions, along with support for \"reasonable gun safety measures\" and stronger border security.Nebraska has nearly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats, making Democrats' bids in the state often fruitless. Indeed, a Democrat hasn't held statewide office in Nebraska since 2012. And Trump won Nebraska by nearly 20 points in 2020.But Nebraska is also home to nearly as many nonpartisan voters as Democrats, meaning the two groups could feasibly come together to rival the number of registered Republicans in the state to elect a candidate, despite the state's leanings.\u00a0Still, previous Senate bids from independent candidates in red states under similar conditions have ultimately fallen short, like in Utah in 2022 and Alaska in 2020. The Cook Political Report, which shifted the race's rating late last month from solid to likely Republican, cited the outcomes in an analysis, while noting that Osborn's background differs from the other independent candidates.\u00a0\n\n\nAdkins said something is being \"tested here that we haven't seen in Nebraska before,\" where the minority party doesn't field a candidate when a moderate or independent candidate is running, bucking the typical dynamic where the race is all-but decided after the Republican primary.\u00a0\"This campaign just got started,\" he said.\u00a0\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska Senate race surprise: It's \"more competitive than it should be\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamala Harris proposes Medicare pay for more in-home health care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris and Trump's positions on Iran and Israel as tensions flare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the music: Latino celebrities and presidential politics in the 2024 election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Trump spending would both boost the U.S. debt.

He looked down but had no visible reaction as he heard the sentences for each count of murder, which will run concurrently. The jurors had deliberated for more than 10 hours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Tuttle then sat on the witness stand with a framed photograph of his father and stepmother. He said they were \"victims of severe systematic failure in police work, particularly with the supervision of Gerald Goines.\"\"My father and my stepmother were not involved in any drug dealing. They were good people. They did not deserve this,\" he said, and then stared at Goines as he walked away.\n\n\nProsecutors said Goines falsely claimed an informant had bought heroin at the couple's home from a man with a gun, setting up the violent confrontation in which the couple was killed and four officers, including Goines, were shot and wounded, and a fifth was injured. A Texas Ranger who investigated the raid testified that the officers fired first, killing the dog and likely provoking Tuttle's gunfire.His lawyers acknowledged he lied to get the search warrant, but sought to diminish the impact. Two witnesses \u2014a fellow officer and the judge who signed the warrant\u2014 said the raid never would have happened if Goines had told the truth.The probe into the drug raid uncovered allegations of much wider corruption. Goines was among a dozen officers tied to the narcotics squad who were indicted on other charges. A judge dismissed charges against some of them, but a review of thousands of cases involving the unit led prosecutors to dismiss many cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has overturned at least 22 convictions linked to Goines.Defense attorney Nicole DeBorde had asked for the minimum sentence of five years, saying Goines had dedicated his life to keeping drugs off the streets. \"Our community is safer with someone like Gerald, with the heart to serve and the heart to care,\" she said.\n\n\nProsecutors asked for life in prison, telling jurors that Goines preyed upon people he was supposed to protect with a years-long pattern of corruption that has severely damaged the relationship between law enforcement and the community.\"We filed our notice of appeal. We think we have some excellent appellate issues. We still don't believe legally that he is guilty of the crime of felony murder and we look forward to having the appellate courts review this,\" DeBorde, one of Goines' attorneys, told reporters after the sentence was read.Investigators later found only small amounts of marijuana and cocaine in the house, and while Houston's police chief at the time, Art Acevedo, initially praised Goines as being \"tough as nails,\" he later suspended him when the lies emerged. Goines later retired as the probes continued.Goines also made a drug arrest in 2004 in Houston of George Floyd, whose 2020 death at the hands of a Minnesota police officer sparked a nationwide reckoning on racism in policing. A Texas board in 2022 declined a request that Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for that drug conviction.Goines also faces federal criminal charges in connection with the raid, and federal civil rights lawsuits filed by the families of Tuttle and Nicholas against Goines, 12 other officers and the city of Houston are set to be tried in November.Nicholas' family expressed gratitude after Goines' convictions in a statement saying that \"the jury saw this case for what it was: Vicious murders by corrupt police, an epic cover-up attempt and a measure of justice, at least with Goines.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vice President Harris, Gov.

Somebody told me to get behind a chair in the main suite and not move. Everyone was trying to hide behind something, to stay out of the fucking way. So I hid and watched as he took things by the handful, by the armful, and threw them off the balcony. He had found his flight path and he was going to fly it until he was done throwing stuff off that balcony.\n\n\nEventually, he calmed down, and someone said to me, \"It's okay, you can come out now, he wants to see you.\"I thought, He wants to see me?I said, \"Why was he so mad?\"\"Well,\" someone said, \"he ran out of water.\"\n\n\nSo, I grabbed four bottles of water and I walked into his room.\"Somebody told me you didn't have any water,\" I said, and he just motioned for me to come give him a hug.He was respectful, though\u2014he wasn't rude to people, he wasn't an angry person, he didn't live there. Some people full-on live in destruction, others buy some real estate and walk around in anger for a little while. My dad would just visit.Sometimes my dad would take me to an amusement park in Memphis called Libertyland, and he would close it down for me and all the entourage and their families and friends. He and I would ride on the roller coasters. I loved it.One of my dad's visits to anger came one time when we were supposed to go to Libertyland. I had invited all my friends, but when I went upstairs the night before, I could hear the wrong kind of tone\u2014this baritone sound, the wrong kind of intensity. I went to my room and could hear loud crashing sounds. He was yelling his fucking head off at somebody. I could hear him saying that we weren't going to Libertyland the next day. I was devastated.I found out later that he had run out of something again, and he needed to get it before we went\u2014either that or they wouldn't give it to him. So, he hit the roof and called about ten different doctors and nurses until he found someone who would give him a fix. Once the nurse or doctor had administered whatever it was he needed, he was fine. And we went to Libertyland.I remember sitting next to him on the roller coaster that day\u2014the Zippin Pippin\u2014keeping one eye ahead on the ride, and the other on his gun in his holster, which was on my side. Unless you knew or understood him, that sounds terrible, I know. You might think he was crazy, carrying a piece with his daughter sitting next to him, but he was just from the South. It was just really funny.\n\n\nSo we rode and rode.That was about a week before he died.\nOprah Winfrey named \"From Here to the Great Unknown\" her 108th book club pick on Tuesday, Oct. 8.\n\n            \n                Handout\n\n                          \nFrom the book: FROM HERE TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN by Lisa Marie Presley and Riley Keough.

On Tuesday, however, a district court in Braunschweig acquitted him of sexual offense charges unrelated to McCann's disappearance - acts allegedly committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.Brueckner had faced three rape charges and two counts of sexual abuse in the case ruled on Tuesday, in which prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison sentence as well as preventive detention after his term. A panel of three judges, led by Uta Engemann, ruled in favor of the defense, which had argued there was insufficient credible evidence to convict him on the charges.\nChristian Brueckner, right, a suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal, speaks with his lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher as they wait for the verdict in a trial on unrelated sexual assault charges in Braunschweig, Germany, Oct. 8, 2024.\n\n            \n                Michael Matthey/Pool/REUTERS\n\n                          \nBrueckner is already serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal, so despite the Tuesday ruling, he will likely remain behind bars, completing that sentence, until September 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defendant's lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said the prosecution's case at the Braunschweig district court lacked reliable witnesses, and he argued that Brueckner had only been targeted due to his public links to the high-profile McCann case.\"It became clear during the proceedings that prejudgment by the media had played a significant role in shaping public perceptions and influencing witnesses,\" Engemann said as she delivered the ruling on Tuesday, emphasizing that the judicial oath she'd taken committed her to ensuring due process of law for all accused parties.\n\n\n\"Even a Christian Brueckner has the right to have a constitutional (fair) trial,\" she said, adding: \"The court's ruling might be disappointing for those involved, but that's how it works in a constitutional system.\"Unlike in the U.S., defendants such as Brueckner are not required to enter a plea to any charge in Germany's legal system, and there is no compulsion for them to testify or respond to charges. Brueckner chose to remain silent during the trial in Braunschweig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Puzzle: Solving the Madeleine McCann Case\n41:42\n\nInvestigations into McCann's abduction continue, and no formal charges have ever been filed against Brueckner in the case. He has consistently denied any involvement in the disappearance of the British toddler from her parents' vacation rental home in southern Portugal \u2014 a mystery that has remained unsolved for more than 17 years.Police in Germany, Portugal and the U.K. have found little solid evidence after almost two decades investigating McCann's disappearance. A new search conducted in mid-2023, around a reservoir not far from where she disappeared, appeared to bring no new insights.\n\n\nBrueckner was identified as a prime suspect in the case in 2022, when German prosecutors said records showed him receiving a phone call on May 3, 2007, near the Praia da Luz apartment from which McCann disappeared. He was already under investigation for various crimes including burglary and child abuse in Portugal.\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man charged in doctor's rape and murder that sparked protests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Public's help sought to identify women in 46 cold cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Russia jails U.S. man, 72, accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Woman charged with 3 murders in 3 days is a serial killer, police say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why an oral surgeon became a murder suspect in girlfriend's death\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Rape\nPortugal\nMissing Girl\nMadeleine McCann\nMurder\nKidnapping\nChild Abduction\nGermany\n\nAnna Noryskiewicz\n\n\nAnna Noryskiewicz is a CBS News journalist based in Berlin, Germany, who covers politics, conflict and crime in Europe and beyond.

In that time, she's dealt with unrelenting attacks from former President Donald Trump as she's defended her record and pitched herself and her plans to the American public.This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Bill Whitaker interviewed Harris and running mate Gov. Tim Walz to learn more about the Democratic ticket's plans on the economy, immigration, foreign affairs and more.It is the third time Whitaker has interviewed Harris and his first sit-down with Walz. The interviews were conducted with less than a month to go before the Nov. 5 election, when Harris and Walz will face off against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel, Harris discusses war in the Middle East\u00a0Whitaker asked Harris if the U.S. lacks influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and whether he is a close ally. President Biden's White House has called for a cease-fire in Gaza, but Israel has pressed on with the war. The administration also called for a cease-fire in Lebanon, before Israel expanded its bombardment there.\u00a0\"I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people,\" Harris said. \"And the answer to that question is yes.\"\n\n\nHow Harris says she'll handle Putin, the Ukraine warWhile the Israel-Hamas war has dominated headlines over the last year since Hamas launched the Oct. 7 terror attack, the Ukraine-Russia war has been grinding on for more than two years.\u00a0Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war without Ukraine's involvement.\u00a0\"Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,\" she said. \"Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. Let's be clear about that. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on Day One.' You know what that is? It's about surrender.\"Harris responds to Trump's decision not to sit down with 60 MinutesVoters will not hear directly from former President Donald Trump during the 60 Minutes election special. Trump, after initially accepting, later declined to participate.\n\n\n\"If he is not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies,\" Harris said. \"You're going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances.\"Voters' top concern: the economyThe economy tops voters' concerns as Election Day nears, but Harris defended the Biden administration's record, pointing to low unemployment numbers. She also touted her campaign proposals to institute a federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries, expand the child tax credit and give tax breaks to first-time home buyers and people starting small businesses.Whitaker asked how she intends to pay for her plans and get them through Congress.\"One of the things is I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes,\" Harris said. \"It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.\"Harris defends immigration record, shares plans for the futureHarris recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers.\u00a0\"It's a longstanding problem,\" Harris said. \"And solutions are at hand. And from Day One, literally, we have been offering solutions.\"Longer-term, Harris said, \"We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.\"\u00a0\n\n\nEarlier this year, bipartisan border security legislation failed after Trump urged Republicans to oppose it.\"Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed,\" she said, \"...and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, 'Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.'\"Gov. Tim Walz on the national stageUnlike his running mate, who has been on the national stage for many years, Democratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. Since Harris chose him as her running mate in August, he's been on a much bigger stage, and facing more scrutiny than ever before.\u00a0He's been criticized for misstatements about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.In his debate with Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance, Walz said, \"I'm a knucklehead at times.\"\u00a0\"I think folks know who I am,\" Walz told Whitaker, adding that he believes people know the difference between someone like him and a \"pathological liar like Donald Trump.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n More from Vice President Harris and Gov.

It also asked whether 60 Minutes would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate for president was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt. 60 Minutes agreed.

Trump claims correspondent Lesley Stahl said, in that interview, that Hunter Biden's controversial laptop came from Russia. She never said that.\u00a0\"Where's my apology? They should apologize,\" Trump said on Tuesday night at a Milwaukee press conference. \"They were wrong on everything. So I'd like to get an apology. So I've asked them for an apology.\"Trump has said Harris doesn't do interviews because she can't handle them. He has declined to participate in a second debate with Harris.

We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine, and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East, one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel.Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov.

We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.Bill Whitaker: We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He's resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.Bill Whitaker: But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.Vice President Kamala Harris: We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.Bill Whitaker: Do we have a--a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people. And the answer to that question is yes.While the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines, it's the economy that most concerns American voters this election year, as always.Bill Whitaker: There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well, better than most countries, I think. But the American people don't seem to be feeling it. Groceries are 25% higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong?Vice President Kamala Harris: We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures.

It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a har-- a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.Bill Whitaker: But\u2014butVice President Kamala Harris: And I plan on making that fair.Bill Whitaker: But we're dealing with the real world here.Vice President Kamala Harris: But the real world includes\u2014\n\n\nBill Whitaker: How are you gonna get this through Congress?\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \nVice President Kamala Harris: You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class, hard-working folk.Bill Whitaker: And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction.Vice President Kamala Harris: I-- I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy. Lemme tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that. I am also a capitalist. And I know the limitations of government.Kamala Harris has been in government for decades; she was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003, then California attorney general, she went on to the U.S. Senate, and now vice president.Bill Whitaker: A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you. They don't know what makes you tick. And-- and why do you think that is? What\u2013what's the disconnect?Vice President Kamala Harris: It's an election, Bill. And I take-- it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: Lemme tell you what your critics and the columnists say.Vice President Kamala Harris: OK.Bill Whitaker: They say that the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all, now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that.\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris: In the last four years I have been vice president of the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values, to find common-sense solutions. And that has been my approach.But one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden/Harris approach has been inconsistent, and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president's achilles heel.Bill Whitaker: You recently visited the southern border and-- embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?Vice President Kamala Harris: The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with the border security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, \"Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward.\"\n\n\nBill Whitaker: But I've been covering the border for-- for years. And so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration.Vice President Kamala Harris: Correct. Correct.Bill Whitaker: But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?Vice President Kamala Harris: It's a longstanding problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions.\nBill Whitaker and Vice President Kamala Harris\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \nBill Whitaker: What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?Vice President Kamala Harris: I think-- the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay? But the--Bill Whitaker: But the numbers did quadruple under your--\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: And the numbers today--Bill Whitaker: --under your watch--Vice President Kamala Harris: --because of what we have done-- we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the--Bill Whitaker: But should you have done that--Vice President Kamala Harris: --flow of fentanyl--Bill Whitaker: --should you have done that--\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris: --by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.\u00a0\n\n\nBill Whitaker: You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?Vice President Kamala Harris: I am glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say, \"It's just wrong. It's just wrong.\"Bill Whitaker: With so many people supporting Donald Trump, a man you have called a racist. How do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap?Vice President Kamala Harris: I believe that the people of America want a leader who's not tryin' to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up.\u00a0The Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us, she's lost track of how many states she's visited.\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris: How are you doing?Bill Whitaker: I'm doing well.\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: You well?We joined her on the trail late last week, in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party.\u00a0And at a rally plastered with \"country over party\" banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6th Committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump's fiercest critics.\u00a0Liz Cheney: I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year, I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris (applause)That proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd\u2026Bill Whitaker: Four years ago if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them?Vice President Kamala Harris: That'd be great. (laughter)\n\n\nLiz Cheney: She's really diplomatic. (laughter)Bill Whitaker: Would you ever have thought that you'd be campaigning with Kamala Harris?Liz Cheney: I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, \"Our constitution is going to be under threat and it's gonna be crucial for the parties to come together-- and to support Vice President Harris because she'll defend the rule of law\"-- I know I would've said, \"That's exactly what I'll do.\"Whoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she's determined the U.S must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine?Bill Whitaker: What does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine?Vice President Kamala Harris: There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN charter participating in what that success looks like.Bill Whitaker: Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine?\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?Vice President Kamala Harris: Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, \"Oh, he can end it on day one.\" You know what that is? It's about surrender.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: A hard left turn here. But-- you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner and that if someone came into your house--Vice President Kamala Harris: That was not the first time I've-- I've--Bill Whitaker: --they would get shot.Vice President Kamala Harris: --talked about it. That's not the first time I've talked about it.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: So what kind of gun do you own, and when and why did you get it?Vice President Kamala Harris: I have a Glock, and-- I've had it for quite some time. And-- I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement. And-- so there you go.\u00a0Bill Whitaker: Have you-- ever fired it?Vice President Kamala Harris: Yes. (laugh) Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course I have.Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz was little-known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a six-term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Sen. JD Vance \"weird\" that may have landed him on the ticket.\n\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \nBill Whitaker: Two months ago, you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now, you're running together, vying for the top offices in the land. It's not possible that you agree on everything.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team?Gov. Tim Walz: Well\u2014I\u2014she'd probably disagreed with\u2014she said, \"Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say (laugh) things,\" whatever it might be.\u00a0Whatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record, and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.Bill Whitaker: In your debate with JD Vance, you said, \"I'm a knucklehead (laugh) at times.\" And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah.Bill Whitaker: Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?Gov. Tim Walz: I think folks know who I am. And I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by--you--rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump.\n\n\nBill Whitaker: But I think it comes down to the question of whether\u2014whether you can be trusted to tell the truth.Gov. Tim Walz: Yeah. Well-- I can-- I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word.\u00a0Walz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents.Bill Whitaker: Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal. Radical left, he calls it. So, what do you say to that criticism, that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country?Gov. Tim Walz: President Trump may be referring to that \u2013 that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talkin' about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for, \"What\u2014what is his solution? Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic, we walk on water half the year (laugh).It was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris's running mate.Bill Whitaker: Before you joined the\u2013 ticket, you called Republicans \"weird.\" And that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck?\n\n\nGov. Tim Walz: I was really talking about the behaviors. Being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal \u2013folks legally here eating cats and dogs, they're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this: it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way and let's try and find an objective truth again.Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance.Bill Whitaker: You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to, to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that?Vice President Kamala Harris: If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he is gonna try to bring the country together, find common ground. And, Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page.Produced by Marc Lieberman and Rome Hartman.

The former president falsely claimed the election was stolen. Republican Stephen Richer was elected as Maricopa County recorder in 2020. In 2021, he took over the office, which records voter registration and handles ballots by mail in the county. He explains no widespread fraud has been found in the county's 2020 election, which he believes is the \"most scrutinized election in human history.\" Still, allegations of fraud persist.\u00a0Reviewing the results of the 2020 electionRicher took office after the 2020 election, when his own party was up in arms over allegations of fraud. It was Richer's first elected office and he knew what to do. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They just need answers,\" Richer said he thought. \"It's not that complicated of an issue. It's just people are uncertain. They expected Donald Trump to win. I expected Donald Trump to win in Maricopa County. He didn't win. They have questions. As soon as we give them logical, factual answers, all will be well.\"\nStephen Richer\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \nBut that's not what happened. There were multiple investigations. The Republican-led State Senate commissioned a hand recount of Maricopa County's 2.1 million paper ballots, which reconfirmed Mr. Biden won. Statewide, prosecutions for illegal voting involved a total of 19 ballots.\u00a0\n\n\nIn May of 2021, Trump said \"the entire database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been deleted,\" calling it an \"unbelievable election crime.\"\u00a0Richer remembers being in the office on a Saturday afternoon looking at a database Trump was saying had been deleted.\u00a0\"The ludicrous nature of it, it just is offensive,\" he said.\u00a0Richer called for the \"lies\" to stop.\n\n\n\"This is as disprovable as saying two plus two equals five,\" he said.\u00a0Election officials face threatsRicher faced threats after he spoke out and defended the county's results. After a meeting in 2021, Richer says he was heckled and followed to his car.\u00a0Three violent threats to Richer have been prosecuted. Frederick Francis Goltz, who pleaded guilty to a charge of interstate threatening communications, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. The others are awaiting trial.The threats didn't stop after 2020. Just months ago, Richer was booed when he said he didn't believe the 2020 election was stolen.He's far from alone in facing threats. Republican Clint Hickman served as the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 2020, which is responsible for certifying the election.\u00a0He has been a supervisor on the board for 11 years and was among Trump's most loyal supporters in 2020. Then-President Trump publicly thanked him in 2020 at a campaign rally days before the election. But after all the votes were tallied, Hickman found no evidence of fraud and said so when he and the Republican majority Board of Supervisors voted to certify the county's election. Since then, he says he has been accused of treason and received death threats.\"I've lost count. I have lost count,\" Hickman said. \"And so have my colleagues. And so have election workers.\"\n\n\nIn one instance, Hickman got a call from Mark A. Rissi, who threatened to \"lynch your stupid lying Commie a\u2014.\"\u00a0\nClint Hickman\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \nRissi, who in the voicemail went on to threaten to hang him, received a two-and-a-half year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications. Hickman recalled another message he received he called \"chilling\".The caller stated, \"'We know the restaurants that you are in. And we know where your kids go to school,'\" Hickman said.Ongoing allegations of fraudMaricopa County Republican Party vice-chair Shelby Busch started a political action committee which investigates what she claims is widespread fraud in Maricopa County's elections.\u00a0\"What I am doing is, I am shining a big bright light on the disdain and the arrogance of some of the elected officials,\" she said. \"They are elected to represent the interests of the people. And until they are ready to step up and do that, then there will be unrest.\"Busch believes state statutes and regulations were violated. She still questions whether signature verification was proper and whether some ballots were collected illegally. In a recent case, a judge disqualified Busch \u2014 an administrator in a medical practice \u2014 from testifying as an expert because he said she was \"obviously unqualified...not even in the ballpark.\"\"That's one judge's opinion who is a radical leftist who is legislating from the bench and I don't believe that it had any merit in my credibility whatsoever,\" she said.\n\n\n\"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Busch if there was any danger in undermining people's faith in the election system by continuing to share unvalidated conspiracy theories about the election.Busch disagreed with Pelley, saying she believed allegations of fraud have been validated.\"I don't need a government official with a vested interest in disproving information to tell me whether what I have is valid. It's up to each individual citizen, as a member of this society, to review the evidence, to think for themselves and make those decisions,\" she said.Busch called for people to determine what's valid and said she doesn't have time to worry about whether people believe her.\"I have what I believe is the mission that I am on, and that mission is for my children and my grandchildren,\" she said. \"I'm not here to make friends. I am here to do a job.\"In a speech, recorded on video earlier this year, Busch said she would \"lynch\" Richer.\u00a0\"If Stephen Richer walked in this room, I would lynch him,\" she said in March. \"I don't unify with people who don't believe in the principles we believe in and the American cause that founded this country.\"\n\n\nBusch later said she was referring to a \"political lynching.\"\"It's referred to as destroying someone's career. It was not ever meant physically in any way, shape, or form,\" Busch said. \"Probably a poor choice of words.\"What's next for Maricopa CountyRicher, who fought to defend the legitimacy of Maricopa's elections, lost his reelection bid this July during the Republican primary election.\"I've become much more cynical about politics. There are a lot of people who have no lines in the sand. A lot of politicians,\" Richer said. \"A lot of politicians for whom it's like oxygen, that if you told them they weren't going to be reelected, it would be like unplugging them from oxygen. So whichever way the winds are blowing, even if it's highly immoral, that they're on for the ride.\"He worries about what may happen on Nov. 5 and in the aftermath that allegations of widespread fraud and threats of violence against election officials could continue.Fighting election fraud allegations across the countryArizona isn't the only state dealing with false claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 contest. A group of prominent conservatives, including attorney Ben Ginsberg, spent a year investigating claims the 2020 election was stolen. The group, which includes conservative judges and senators, authored \"Lost, Not Stolen,\" an investigation that exposes election fraud lies.\u00a0\"The evidence to back up the allegations of fraud and elections being unreliable simply does not exist,\" Ginsberg said.\nRepublican election attorney Benjamin Ginsberg\u00a0\n\n            \n                Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n                          \nPart of the report centers on Trump's swing state lawsuits.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Donald Trump and his supporters brought 64 cases. They lost 63 of them outright,\" Ginsberg explained. The case they won related to a small number of ballots \"far from outcome determinative,\" he says.\u00a0Election deniers have said that they lost in court because the judges weren't fair.\"Under the rule of law, you have every right to submit your litigation,\" Ginsberg said. \"But under the rule of law, a conservative principle, a Republican principle for as long as I've been practicing election law, you have to accept the rulings of the court.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Arizona election officials work to restore confidence in results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How 60 Minutes found out Trump would not participate in election special\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vice President Harris, Gov.

How would that affect the federal debt?", "Author": "Kate Gibson; Editor(s): Alain Sherter", "Date": "Updated on:  October 8, 2024 / 7:08 AM EDT", "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made numerous promises, some in the realm of vague pledges and others backed by detailed policies, that carry hefty price tags. But Trump's proposals would add twice as much red ink to the nation's debt over the next decade as those advanced by Harris, a new analysis finds.\u00a0The report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a nonprofit group that focuses on fiscal issues, projected that the former president's proposals would increase the national debt by $7.5 trillion through 2035. The vice president's policies would raise the debt by $3.5 trillion, estimates CRFB, which pushes for lower government deficits.\u00a0The committee offered a range of estimates in its report due to a lack of specifics in each candidate's proposals. Depending on those all-important details, Harris' proposals could range from having essentially no financial impact on the federal debt to raising it by $8.1 trillion, the group estimates. Trump's plans could expand the debt by between $1.5 trillion on the low side and up to $15.2 trillion, according to CRFB. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will face an unprecedented fiscal situation upon taking office,\" the committee\u00a0stated\u00a0in its report. \"Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for president have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.\"\u00a0\nKamala Harris' policy proposals and estimated costs.\n\n            \n                Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\n\n                          \n\nDonald Trump's policy proposals and estimated costs.\n\n            \n                Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\n\n                          \nMuch of the cost baked into Trump's proposals comes from his plan to\u00a0extend tax cuts\u00a0contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which CRPB estimates would add more than $5 trillion over a decade to the nation's nearly $36 trillion national debt. His plan to eliminate taxes on overtime, tips and Social Security benefits would cost another $3.6 trillion, CRFB estimated. And conducting mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would increase the debt by another $350 billion, it calculated.\u00a0\n\n\n\"The CRFB opposed President Trump's highly successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and supported the catastrophic Inflation Reduction Act, which passed only as a result of Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote,\" Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, told CBS News in a statement. \"President Trump's historic tax cuts laid the foundation for robust, non-inflationary growth that fueled more revenue for the federal government, not less.\"\"President Trump's plan will rein in wasteful spending, defeat inflation, reduce the burden of interest costs and ignite economic growth that fuels federal revenue, so we can make our economy great again,\" Hughes added.A representative from the Harris campaign didn't immediately offer comment on CRFB's analysis.\u00a0The Republican nominee has argued that tariffs on U.S. imports would cover the tax cuts, but the study findings challenge that claim. Many economists also contend that Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China and other trading partners would increase prices for consumers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 60 Minutes Interview\n20:49\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, so rather than easing inflation they can worsen it,\" according to David Ortega, an economist and a professor at Michigan State University's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.\u00a0\n\n\nHarris would add $3 trillion to the national debt by extending tax cuts for people earning less than $400,000 a year, and another $1.4 trillion by expanding the Child Tax Credit\u00a0and Earned Income Tax Credit, according to CRFB. The Democrat's campaign has said the plans would cost much less.\u00a0Harris has also called for an end to income taxes on tips, but the proposal includes keeping payroll tax requirements and restrictions on what type of employees would be eligible, costing $200 billion, CRFB estimated.\u00a0\n\n\nElection 2024\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska Senate race surprise: It's \"more competitive than it should be\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKamala Harris proposes Medicare pay for more in-home health care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris and Trump's positions on Iran and Israel as tensions flare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the music: Latino celebrities and presidential politics in the 2024 election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Trump spending would both boost the U.S. debt.

Israel launched the war in immediate response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks, when the group fired hundreds of rockets and militants stormed across the Gaza border, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 more as hostages.\u00a0In addition to lives lost, the United Nations estimates that the war has displaced 90% of Gaza's roughly 2.3 million people. Many of them \u2014 unable to leave the embattled enclave \u2014 have been displaced multiple times within Gaza as they try to escape the Israeli airstrikes that have decimated its towns and cities.As of January, the war had caused around $18.5 billion in damage to infrastructure in Gaza, according to the U.N. and the World Bank.

The U.N. and World Bank said 84% of health facilities and 92% of primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed by January, and the bombing has continued since then. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to assess destruction in GazaIt has not been possible to comprehensively map destruction in Gaza from the ground. International journalists have not been allowed inside Gaza, apart from on highly restricted tours offered by the Israeli military, since the war started.\u00a0Palestinian journalists covering the conflict have had minimal security and been subjected to evacuation orders and restrictions on their movements like everyone else in the enclave. At least 116 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\n\nGiven the difficulties of on-the-ground assessment, a team of researchers based in the U.S. have used data and other resources from the European Space Agency and NASA to map indicators of damage in conflict zones, including Gaza.\"The satellite data, specifically, is not a picture like you would think from a normal camera,\" Corey Scher, at the City University of New York, explained to CBS News. \"This is radar, so it shoots a burst of radar into the Earth that echoes back to the sensor, and we can get an idea of this three dimensional structure and arrangement of an area in a way that you don't get with an optical image.\"The technique allows the team to track indicators of destruction more quickly than is possible by analyzing traditional satellite imagery, which can take many weeks, Scher said.Mapping the situation on the groundCBS News has used data provided by Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, an Associate Professor of Geography at Oregon State University who's also worked on the project, to map the indicators of destruction in Gaza over the course of the war in an effort to reveal the overall extent of the damage to infrastructure.\n\n\nScroll through the map below to see how the damage escalated over the course of the last 12 months. \n\n\n\n\n  \"Over time, it becomes inevitable that people are displaced to areas where there are just - there is no safety, there is no shelter that can support\u2026 the population. The food insecurity, lack of access to water, just the constant uprooting on top of the background of damage is also extremely unique in this conflict,\" Van Den Hoek said.\"The pace of the bombing, the breadth of the bombing, that resulted in this damage was extremely unique,\" said Van Den Hoek, adding that it was the most destruction he had seen in any of the conflicts he's looked at in his work with Oregon State's Conflict Ecology lab.\"Over time, it becomes inevitable that people are displaced to areas where there are just - there is no safety, there is no shelter that can support\u2026 the population.

By September 2024, Touma said all the school buildings still standing were being used as shelters for displaced people.In January 2024, Israel accused 12 UNWRA employees of participating in the Oct. 7 attacks. After an internal U.N. investigation, the global body fired nine of its staffers, accepting that they may have taken part in the attacks. The agency employs some 13,000 people in Gaza and, as of September 2024, the U.N. said at least 222 of its team members had been killed in the war.\"What is the fate of these children who used to go to these buildings that are now either destroyed or severely damaged, or they continue to house people and continue to provide shelter for displaced families?\" Touma said. \"Even if there is a miracle and we have a cease-fire tomorrow, what will this mean for education? And how will children be able to go back to school? Because\u2026 70% of our schools in Gaza cannot be used.\"The destruction and successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many people to flee to increasingly difficult places to survive, including hundreds of thousands crammed into the coastal area of al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis. Israel's military has designated al-Mawasi a humanitarian zone, but before the war, it had \"no facilities for human beings,\" Touma said.\"People just started setting up shop there, meaning putting these plastic sheeting with, you know, wooden boards and living anywhere and everywhere,\" she told CBS News. \"At some point, Mawasi had a million people.\"But even al-Mawasi has been bombed. The most deadly attack was in July, when 90 people were killed and 300 wounded. Israel said it targeted and killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' military wing, with the strike.\"A damaged building is a proxy for a displaced family, a displaced group of, you know, a school or a bakery,\" Scher said. \"It's also an indicator of a potential hazard for an unexploded ordnance\u2026 It's a proxy for everything that's happening on the ground.\"\n\n\nCrisis in the Middle East\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBS News' Marwan al-Ghoul on a year trapped in the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael and Hamas at war: A timeline of major events since Oct. 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData helps map destruction in Gaza since Israel-Hamas war began\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIA director warns \"misjudgments\" could further escalate Middle East conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-generated video purportedly showing fiery Beirut skyline goes viral\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          War\nHamas\nIsrael\nPalestinians\nGaza Strip\nWar Crimes\nMiddle East\nBenjamin Neta\u200bnyahu\n\nHaley Ott\n\n\nHaley Ott is the CBS News Digital international reporter, based in the CBS News London bureau.\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n                  Instagram\n                \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-william-burns-warns-misjudgments-could-escalate-conflict-israel-hamas-lebanon/", "Title": "CIA director warns \"misjudgments\" could further escalate conflict in Middle East", "Author": "Olivia Gazis", "Date": "Updated on:  October 8, 2024 / 12:24 AM EDT", "content": "CIA Director William Burns warned Monday of the potential for simmering clashes in the Middle East to spread across the region even as, he said, the U.S. intelligence community had assessed the leaders of Iran and Israel are not looking for \"all-out conflict.\"\"[W]e face the very real danger of a further regional escalation of conflict,\" Burns said during a moderated question-and-answer session at the annual Cipher Brief threat conference in Sea Island, Georgia.

He acknowledged, however, that Iran was in a \"much closer position\" to create a single bomb's worth of weapons-grade material, with a breakout time now at \"a week or a little more.\"Speaking one year after Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping more than 250, Burns \u2014 who had for the past year been leading diplomatic negotiations alongside counterparts from Qatar, Egypt and Israel\u2014 expressed hope that a diplomatic deal could still be struck for a ceasefire and to secure the release of remaining hostages in Gaza.\"We've come close at least a couple of times, but it's been very elusive,\" he said. Talks on Gaza had come to a standstill in recent weeks as, U.S. officials said, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar had stopped responding to updated proposals.\"[W]hat's at stake in Gaza is shaped by political will,\" Burns stressed. \"In the end, it's not just about brackets in texts or creative formulas when you're trying to negotiate a hostage and ceasefire deal. It's about leaders who ultimately have to recognize that enough is enough, that perfect is rarely on the menu, especially in the Middle East.\"\n\n\n\"And then you've got to go make hard choices and some compromises in the interest of a longer-term strategic stability as well,\" he said.\n\n\nCrisis in the Middle East\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBS News' Marwan al-Ghoul on a year trapped in the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael and Hamas at war: A timeline of major events since Oct. 7, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData helps map destruction in Gaza since Israel-Hamas war began\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIA director warns \"misjudgments\" could further escalate Middle East conflict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-generated video purportedly showing fiery Beirut skyline goes viral\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Central Intelligence Agency\nIran\nIsrael\nLebanon\nMiddle East\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-storage-programs-suicide-prevention/", "Title": "Can gun storage programs stop suicides? This researcher says safeguarding a firearm \"until the crisis subsides\" can make all the difference.", "Author": "T. Sean Herbert", "Date": "Updated on:  October 7, 2024 / 10:13 PM EDT", "content": "Suicide by firearm is a uniquely fatal epidemic, with roughly 90% of attempts lethal. More than half of U.S. suicide deaths involve guns. It's prompting calls for a new approach many think might make a big difference: gun storage initiatives. Caleb Morse, a veteran who served in Iraq, told CBS News he's \"lost more friends to suicide than I did in combat.\" That's one of the reasons he started offering to store firearms for friends and community members in need at his gun shop, Rustic Renegade, in Lafayette, Louisiana. From 2002 to 2021, nearly 87,000 veterans died by gun suicide \u2014 16 times the number of service members killed in action over the same period, the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety found in a 2024 report. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2018, Morse has stored roughly 400 firearms, safely keeping them until their owners were ready to reclaim them, potentially saving numerous lives. Louisiana has passed legislation shielding gun store owners who hold onto guns from liability litigation. Morse and others like him can make a big difference in stopping suicides by firearm because chances are high that owners who don't have easy access to their guns during a moment of crisis won't die, said Rutgers professor Michael Anestis, a clinical psychologist. Over 70% of those who survive a suicide attempt don't try again, he said.\n\n\nAnestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and one of the nation's top researchers developing gun storage frameworks and projects, spoke to CBS News about Americans vulnerable to suicide,  steps people can take to help a loved one and how gun storage programs can make a difference.CBS News: How do guns fit into the story of American suicide?Michael Anestis: You can't really talk about American suicide without talking about firearms. More than half of all the suicide deaths in America are self-inflicted gunshot wounds. There's a pretty clear relationship between firearm access and suicide death. So whether you're the firearm owner yourself or anybody who lives in the home [where] there's a firearm present, their risk for death by suicide goes up three to five times. And it's not that the firearm makes them vulnerable to thinking about suicide. It's just that if someone is thinking about suicide and they have quick and ready access to the most lethal method, then they're at greater risk of dying. If you take all the other suicide attempts together in the United States to combine them, less than 5% of those attempts to result in death. There's nothing that compares to firearms in terms of how deadly they are in a suicide attempt.\n\n\nCBS News: When we look across the American landscape, which communities are most vulnerable?Anestis: The communities that are historically known to be firearm owners are also the ones at greatest risk for firearm suicide. So, often that's White men, that's folks in rural spaces, that's middle-aged or older adults. That's folks with a history of military service or who've worked in law enforcement communities that are more prone to owning firearms and are more prone to firearm suicide. Those who are dying by suicide are predominantly men. Most of them probably have families, they're middle-aged men and they're the ones who maybe are supposed to be the protectors.CBS News: Why are veterans so vulnerable?Anestis: Veterans have a great amount of training and comfort with firearms. A very high percentage of veterans are firearm owners relative to the rest of the community. So they have more experience, more comfort and more opportunity. And then there's just a lot of aspects that go into the life of veterans separating from military service and finding a new mission in life. And when you combine all of those factors with quick, ready access to a firearm, you unfortunately get a tragedy like suicide.CBS News: When is a firearm owner at greatest risk of suicide? Are there warning signs?Anestis: It's a very common story for the folks who die by suicide, especially by firearm, to not have asked for help, not have sought help, not told anyone about their suicidal thoughts. So the best thing you can do is try and make the environment less conducive to a suicide attempt. That means, you know, locking away methods for suicide. That could be medication. A lot of times though, that means locking up a firearm or finding ways of storing outside of the home until the crisis subsides - sort of like you let somebody hold your keys if you've had too much to drink. and then you get 'em back and you sober up.CBS News: Why firearm storage \u2013 why not protective orders, red flag laws?\n\n\nAnestis: There's not one solution that's gonna solve this for everyone or anyone. But what I like about secure storage is that it keeps the decision-making process in the hands of the firearm owner. Firearms are just such a politically divisive issue that people instantly feel like they're being judged or they're having their rights threatened, or someone's telling them what to do. But somewhere along this continuum of safety for which people can plan, we can make plans for adapting all sorts of ways. We can keep ourselves and our loved ones and our property safe. There are tons of options for firearm storage - gun safes, gun lock boxes, Pelican cases - and each of these different kinds of devices have different kinds of locking mechanisms. It could be a key, a code, like you have a locker.CBS News: What does an America that regularly uses firearm storage look like?Anestis: It's an America with far fewer suicide deaths and making it less deadly or less available across the globe and methods. It's a story that results in massive and sustained reductions in the overall suicide rate.Editor's note: This transcript has been lightly edited and condensed.If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988.

There are more than 45,000 people experiencing homelessness in the city of Los Angeles, according to the city's Homeless Services Authority. King says many of them suffer from serious medical illnesses.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are patients that have schizophrenia, have HIV. So I think there's urgency from everyone to solve this,\" King said.Nearly half of all homeless people in the U.S. live in California, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The state had roughly one shelter bed for every three people who needed one last year, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\n\nEarlier this year, leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom were empowered to take action in clearing homeless encampments after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled cities could ban people from sleeping outside.\"It's time to move forward with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites... there are no longer any excuses,\" Newsom said in a video posted to social media.Easy to say, perhaps, but the reality is more complicated.\"The goal has got to be to solve the problem,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \"Our problem here is we don't have enough housing. We need to build, we need to purchase buildings.\"\n\n\nBass is focused on getting people off the streets and into shelters that up until now did not exist. She's doing it by leveraging empty motels and city-owned properties with the goal of moving people indoors urgently and clearing encampments permanently.\"You don't solve anything by clearing an encampment and just moving them to the next street,\" Bass said.Since 2022, Bass's \"Inside Safe\" program has brought more than 3,000 people indoors from over 60 encampments, the city says. The city has seen a 10% drop in street homelessness. Pointing to an empty patch of grass next to a playground, Bass said, \"This area right here, many months ago was filled with tents. And you can imagine what family wants to bring their kids here \u2014right there\u2014 if this is filled with tents and you're afraid of the people that are here. And look at it now.\"While some people have been able to find interim housing, others are still waiting. \"We're dealing with massive numbers, so it is gonna take a while. I wish I could tell you that on this date, this problem would be ended. I can't do that, but what I do know is that if we continue along with the trajectory that we're headed on, we will be able to solve this problem,\" Bass said.It's an approach that could also solve a problem for Dr. King, who often loses contact with people who need more consistent care.\n\n\n\"We may lose them and we may lose them forever, because they are that sick. I have faith that here we're already on that pathway to try to do this the right way,\" King said.A crisis decades in the making is slowly changing, one day and one life at a time. \n\n\nEye On America\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan gun storage initiatives help prevent suicides?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Los Angeles is addressing homelessness after Supreme Court ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow replica guns are getting Americans killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome hospice care in the spotlight as Jimmy Carter turns 100\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Los Angeles\nSupreme Court of the United States\nHomelessness\nHousing Crisis\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/replica-guns-getting-americans-killed/", "Title": "How replica guns are getting Americans killed", "Author": "Cait Bladt", "Date": "October 2, 2024 / 8:18 PM EDT", "content": "In 2023, more than 12 million BB and pellet guns were bought in the United States. Many have roughly the same weight, markings and finishes as real guns. But these look-alike replica guns aren't federally required to have any clear indicators that they don't shoot bullets. In most states they are available for adults to purchase without background checks or restrictions.\u00a0Despite not being classified as lethal weapons, having one has gotten people killed.Just this year, 12 people have been shot and killed by police while in possession of a replica gun. Three of them were under the age of 18. Since 2014, at least 320 people have been shot and killed by police while holding replica guns, according to a\u00a0Washington Post database and CBS News review of incidents. Nineteen of those victims were minors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more of these guns get into peoples' hands each year, police, lawmakers and activists are struggling to find ways to keep them safe.\"Almost identical to the real deal\"In the U.S., most toy guns are required to have either a brightly colored tip or colors along the body to distinguish them from real guns \u2014 like the neon colors on Nerf water guns or the orange nub on the muzzle of a toy pistol. Since 1989, it's\u00a0been illegal to \"ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without those markings.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns\" aren't held to that same standard.\u00a0 Due to a loophole in federal law, these types of compressed air guns, shooting small projectiles made of metal, are allowed to look completely realistic without any differentiating marks. Regulators and lawmakers have been saying for years these rules need to change, but the law hasn't been updated since it was created.Some manufacturers, like German-based Umarex USA, have taken full advantage of this loophole. The company's website identifies it as \"the world's largest manufacturer of over-the-counter-firearm replicas\" and lists partnerships with well-known gun companies like Beretta, Colt and Glock. Consumer reviews online rave about how realistic these replicas are. One May 2024 Amazon review for Umarex's Glock 17 Blowback \u2014 currently available for as little as $79.99\u00a0\u2014 reads \"Pistol functions well and is almost identical to the real deal.\" Though the packaging does include a warning that the gun \"may confuse people. \u2026 Police and others may think it is a firearm,\" it has no obvious markings on the actual gun showing it's not a lethal firearm.\"Even in your hand it feels very real,\" Jim Balthazar, a retired special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS News. \"It's not like it's plastic where you can pick it up and it's very light. It's solid and \u2014 it kind of has the comparable weight to a real firearm.\"CBS News met Balthazar at a shooting range where he examined both the Umarex Glock airgun and a real Glock pistol.\n\n\n\"I think it would be superhuman to be able to tell the difference in the midst of an interaction with a suspect, certainly on the street, lighting conditions are not good and so forth \u2026 it looks too real.\"That similarity has sometimes proved to be fatal.Shot for carrying a replicaIn 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers may use deadly force when they reasonably believe \"the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or another person.\" That means if police can't tell whether a gun is a lethal powder gun or a non-lethal BB or pellet gun, they're legally allowed to use deadly force.\"It presents a dilemma for law enforcement officers because it looks so real that officers are going to have to react as if it's a real gun,\" Balthazar said. \"If it's very close, it's not something they're gonna bet their life on and hope that it's a toy.\"Already this year that's proven to be true.On April 26, 17-year-old\u00a0Brandon Salgado was killed by police in Long Beach, California while he was allegedly committing a home robbery. He was armed with a replica gun.On May 1, 14-year-old\u00a0Damian Scott Cadena Haglun brought what looked like a long gun to his middle school in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin and was killed by police outside the building. It was a pellet rifle.\n\n\nOn June 28,\u00a013-year-old Nyah Mway was stopped by police in Utica, New York because they said he fit the description of a robbery suspect. Police said the boy tried to run away and pulled what looked like a handgun out of his pocket. He was shot and killed by police. He had a Umarex Glock BB gun.In September, Mway's family filed a notice preserving their right to bring a lawsuit against the involved police officers and the city of Utica. The officers involved are on paid administrative leave according to the police department and are under investigation by the state attorney general.They're three of the 19 minors who have been killed by police since 2014 while holding replica guns.Utica Police Chief Mark Williams says he holds the manufacturers partially responsible for Mway's death.\"These guns should not be made and manufactured to the exact replica of a real handgun,\" Williams told CBS News. \"They gotta know that eventually these weapons are going to fall in the hands of young kids.\"Lindsay Nichols, policy director of the Giffords Law Center, agrees that the fault lies in part with manufacturers choosing to make and market look-alike pellet guns, and believes the public needs to be able to hold them accountable.\"They know that these guns can be mistaken for real guns. In fact, it's an industry standard these days for them to be sold with warnings that say that brandishing this gun can be dangerous because if it's brandished in public it can be mistaken for a real gun,\" Nichols said. \"They supply those warnings when they sell these guns. So the industry knows these can be dangerous in this particular way.\"\n\n\nCBS News asked firearm manufacturers including Glock why they partner with pellet and BB gun manufacturers, and how much money they make off licensing those look-alikes. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Manufacturers targeting kidsIn the absence of strong federal laws around BB and pellet guns, states have stepped in to try to implement regulations. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently regulate the sale and possession of non-powder guns. Thirteen states \u2013 including New York, Wisconsin and California, where the three minors were killed by police this year \u2013 have laws against underage children buying or possessing pellet or BB guns without parental supervision.But even though states are trying to keep realistic replica guns out of kids' hands, there's evidence that manufacturers have been marketing directly to them for years. A 2012 publication from the National Shooting Sports Foundation stated, \"Youth ambassadors and others should focus on getting newcomers to take a first step into target shooting through any means, whether a BB or pellet gun, paintball gun, or archery bow. The point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms.\"CBS News asked the NSSF for a comment on the recent shootings by police who mistake pellet and BB guns for the real thing. The response: \"We represent firearm manufacturers. BB/pellet guns are not firearms and are not regulated as such. While we do not represent that industry, it is important to note that BB/pellet guns are also not toys and can cause serious physical injury if not used in a responsible manner.\"\"They get teenagers interested in BB guns, and that interest grows into an interest and a desire to purchase real guns. This is part of the gun industry's marketing strategy,\" Nichols said. \"They know that they need new consumers for their profits, and they know that these guns look like real guns \u2026 People will move up to the real guns.\"A patchwork of regulationsSome states have also moved to block the online sale of BB and pellet guns.CBS News tested how effective these restrictions on online purchases of BB guns are by attempting to buy the Umarex Glock 17 from multiple online marketplaces, including Amazon, Ebay and Facebook Marketplace. On each site, reporters used the addresses of police stations in major cities to determine whether the purchase would be possible.\n\n\nThe team was able to place orders to 41 states on Amazon. When using ZIP codes from restricted jurisdictions, the site wouldn't allow the gun to be placed in the online shopping cart and a notification popped up alerting users the purchase was not allowed in that state.Ebay permitted shipping to two additional states \u2013 California and Massachusetts. A pop-up notice during check out on all orders reads \"item is regulated by Part 121 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\" In a statement to CBS News, eBay said: \"eBay policies lay out strict guidelines for the sale of BB guns, airsoft, and air rifles or air pistols, including a disclaimer prohibiting shipping of these items to jurisdictions where they are restricted. Users found violating these policies may face consequences up to, and including, a permanent suspension.\"Facebook Marketplace, where users can sell goods directly to buyers,\u00a0has its own regulations banning the purchase or sale of all \"Paintball, airsoft, and BB guns, and their parts and projectiles.\" Yet CBS News found numerous listings that appeared to violate that policy, making these guns easily accessible either by pickup or delivery. After CBS News notified Meta of the listings, they were removed, though CBS News continued to find new listings. A spokesperson said that 98.4% of problem listings are caught by its systems before being flagged by users.As with real firearms, though, once a BB gun is purchased it's relatively easy to transport across state lines, regardless of local laws.\u00a0Attempts at reforms falterFor decades, some lawmakers have been trying to expand these restrictions, hoping to make these BB and pellet guns harder to access and harder to mistake for the real thing.Democratic New York Rep. Edolphus Towns introduced federal legislation seven times between 1995 and 2007 that would ban or limit the manufacture and sale of toy handguns that had the shape and size of real firearms. None of his bills made it out of committee.In 2014,\u00a0California lawmakers pushed legislation requiring all pellet and BB guns sold in the state to be made out of translucent materials, or have entirely neon colored bodies. The National Rifle Association fought back, claiming that because some real guns are now made with colorful materials, police would confuse the real colorful guns with the colorful BB and pellet guns. Other gun advocates said the colors would lead consumers to wrongly believe pellet and BB guns are toys and therefore safe. The measure failed.\n\n\nBack in 1994, the chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the group that now oversees the sale and production of BB and pellet guns on a federal level, said she wanted further safeguards for kids. That year, several toy stores announced they would no longer be selling realistic toy guns.\u00a0In her statement on the move, Chair Ann Brown wrote, \"Fatal accidents with guns involving kids are tragic. Real-looking toy guns may be a small part of the problem of violence in our society, but it is the part of the problem we can solve. Today, I challenge the toy industry to stop producing any guns that look like or could be modified to look like real guns. This would be a meaningful contribution to the safety of American children.\"Twenty-five years later, still no changes regarding pellet and BB guns had been made to the code. Then in 2019, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal\u00a0sent a letter to the acting chairman of the CPSC demanding \"the CPSC issue regulations to ensure that non-powder guns, including traditional BB guns, look markedly different from real firearms, and imitation and toy guns.\" The senators went on to point out that even when these guns do have colorful tips and tags, they are easily tampered with. They requested the CPSC find new, more tamper-proof ways to differentiate these toy and non-powder guns.The CPSC told CBS News there is \"no planned work to update the regulations,\" and industry groups estimate that the yearly sales of pellet and BB guns will double by 2030.\"It's completely unacceptable. \u2026 All the people that die in this fashion don't need to die,\" Nichols said. \"It's completely preventable if there are simply safety standards and if the industry can be held accountable in court.\"\n\n\nEye On America\n\n              More\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan gun storage initiatives help prevent suicides?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Los Angeles is addressing homelessness after Supreme Court ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow replica guns are getting Americans killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow election deniers are fueling the push to hand count ballots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome hospice care in the spotlight as Jimmy Carter turns 100\n\n\n\n\n\n            More\n            \nIn:\n          Guns\n\nCait Bladt\n\n\nCait Bladt is a writer and producer with the CBS News Confirmed team based in New York.\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/signs-you-should-invest-in-gold-now/", "Title": "4 signs you should invest in gold now", "Author": "Angelica Leicht; Editor(s): Matt Richardson", "Date": "October 8, 2024 / 3:23 PM EDT", "content": "\nThere could be big payoffs to investing in gold in today's economic climate.\n\n            \n                Getty Images\n\n                          \nGold has long been a favored investment, but interest in the precious metal has surged in recent years due to mounting economic pressures. With inflation remaining stubbornly high throughout 2022 and 2023, many investors sought out safer assets to protect their wealth, with gold standing out for its ability to hedge against inflation. That increased demand was further fueled by concerns over rising interest rates and persistent geopolitical tensions, which prompted investors to view gold as a stable and reliable option.\u00a0As we inch closer to the end of 2024, though, the economic landscape is transforming. Inflation has finally cooled, offering some relief to consumers and investors alike and the Federal Reserve has finally begun cutting interest rates, with more rate reductions expected through 2025. These dynamics are creating an environment where many investors are reassessing their strategies to ensure their portfolios can weather what's next.Amid these shifts, though,\u00a0the case for investing in gold remains compelling. Here, we'll break down a few signs that you may want to invest in gold now, despite the shifts occurring within the economic landscape.Add gold to your investment portfolio now.4 signs you should invest in gold nowIf you're wondering whether you should invest in gold right now, the following signs could indicate that this is the right moment to make your move:\n\n\nInflation has cooled \u2014 but risks remainAfter a few years of high inflation, the inflation rate has dropped to a three-year low and is now hovering near the Fed's target of 2%. While this is a welcome relief for many, it doesn't mean inflation risks have entirely disappeared. The economy can and often does change quickly, and there's always a chance that inflation could rise again in the future.\u00a0Gold has always been a reliable hedge against inflation, maintaining its value when the purchasing power of currencies diminishes. So while inflation is low now, the future remains uncertain. Adding gold to your portfolio, then, could be a way to preserve your wealth if and when the inflationary cycles shift.Start investing in gold today.The Federal Reserve has started cutting interest ratesThe Fed made its first rate cut in mid-September and analysts expect that these cuts will continue into 2025 \u2014 with at least two more 25 basis point cuts expected before the end of the year. This matters because lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen rates are low, the appeal of gold increases because investors don't lose out on the higher interest they could be earning elsewhere. As rates drop, gold becomes more attractive as a store of value, particularly if the Fed continues on this path for an extended period. Lower rates also tend to weaken the dollar, which can further boost gold prices.Stock market volatility is picking upWhile the stock market has remained strong overall this year, there have been a few instances of stock market volatility recently. That can be scary, considering that this type of volatility can result in your portfolio's value plunging significantly and it can happen in a matter of minutes. If you're wary of the stock market's penchant for unpredictable swings, gold could be a way to hedge against this volatility.\u00a0When stocks experience sharp corrections or significant fluctuations, gold typically performs well, providing a layer of stability in your portfolio. So, if you're concerned about the possibility of a more significant market downturn or prolonged volatility, adding gold to your investment mix now can help reduce your overall portfolio risk.Gold prices are higher than everGold prices have surged to several all-time highs over the last several months, reflecting growing demand for the asset in an uncertain economic climate. While you might hesitate to invest when gold prices are at a peak, many experts believe that gold still has room to grow \u2014 and could even reach $3,000 per ounce soon.\u00a0If prices continue to rise, getting in now could help you benefit from further appreciation. But if you wait, you could be priced out if gold's price continues its impressive upward ascent, as many experts expect it to do, at least over the shorter term.The bottom lineThe current economic environment presents several compelling reasons to invest in gold. While inflation has cooled, the Fed's rate cuts and increased stock market volatility create a landscape where gold's safe-haven appeal is particularly strong. And while gold prices are at record highs, there's an expectation that its price may increase over time, so this may be the perfect time to add gold to your investment portfolio \u2014 especially if you want to capitalize on future price growth.\u00a0\n\n\nAngelica Leicht\n\n\nAngelica Leicht is senior editor for Managing Your Money, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

With the average credit card rate sitting at an all-time high \u2014 and retail credit card rates averaging over 30% \u2014 it doesn't take much for what should be a manageable balance to balloon out of control. That's why so many people seek out debt forgiveness programs, which are offered by debt relief companies and have the goal of working with your creditors to reduce your total debt.\u00a0The idea of settling your credit card debt for less than what you owe can feel like an attractive solution, and in some cases, it can be, but it also comes with risks. For example, it's not unusual for scammers to prey on those in financial distress, promising quick fixes and unrealistic results. These scams not only fail to resolve your debt but can also add to your financial burden.\u00a0Given the risks, it's important to be able to distinguish between trustworthy companies and those that will take advantage of your situation. That way, you can avoid falling victim to these types of scams.\u00a0Start working with a trustworthy debt relief company today.7 credit card debt forgiveness red flags to watch forThese red flags could indicate a debt forgiveness company may not have your best interests at heart.\n\n\nUpfront feesOne of the biggest red flags when dealing with a debt forgiveness company is if they ask for money upfront. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), it is illegal for debt settlement companies to charge fees before they successfully reduce or settle your debt. Reputable companies only charge for their services after they have made progress on your behalf. Scammers, however, will often demand high upfront fees with the promise of future savings. So, if you encounter a debt relief company asking for payment before they've done any work on your case, it's a major warning sign to pay attention to.Take steps to get rid of your credit card debt now.Guarantees of specific outcomesDebt forgiveness is a complex process that depends heavily on the negotiations with your creditors. As a result, no company can guarantee a specific reduction in your debt or assure you that they can prevent legal actions from your creditors. Any company that promises a guaranteed reduction is likely misleading you. Legitimate debt settlement companies will explain the risks and uncertainties involved and they will never make absolute promises about the outcome.\u00a0Promises to eliminate debt quicklyBe wary of any company that claims they can resolve your credit card debt in just a few months. Scammers may try to lure you in by promising fast results, but in reality, legitimate debt settlements take time \u2014 between two and four years on average. A reputable company, on the other hand, will give you a realistic timeline and be transparent about the steps involved. So if the timeline seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n\nNot disclosing the risksA trustworthy debt forgiveness company will inform you of the risks associated with the process, such as potential damage to your credit score, the possibility of creditors refusing to negotiate and the chance of being sued for unpaid debt. Scammers, on the other hand, may gloss over these risks or fail to mention them altogether. If a company isn't upfront about the potential downsides, they are likely more interested in taking your money than helping you solve your financial problems.High-pressure sales tacticsDebt forgiveness scammers often use high-pressure sales tactics to push you into making a quick decision. They may rush you to sign up for their program or threaten that you'll miss out on a \"limited-time offer\" if you don't act immediately. These tactics are designed to make you feel desperate and prevent you from doing thorough research, so if you feel rushed or pressured, take a step back.A lack of accreditationBefore working with any debt settlement company, check their accreditation and standing with professional organizations like the American Fair Credit Council (AFCC) or the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA). Companies that are not accredited or do not have positive reviews from these organizations may be trying to avoid accountability.\u00a0Vague or incomplete contract termsAlways read the fine print before signing any agreement with a debt forgiveness company. If the contract does not clearly outline the fees, the services provided and the timeframe for settling your debts, you should be cautious. Scammers often rely on vague or misleading contract language to obscure the actual terms of their services, but a legitimate company will provide a contract that spells out all the important aspects of the arrangement.The bottom lineCredit card debt can be a heavy burden, but it's important to choose the right path for relief. Unfortunately, scammers will often try to take advantage of people's financial desperation, offering false promises and charging exorbitant fees for little to no results. By being aware of these red flags, you can protect yourself from falling into a scam and be better prepared to find reputable, accredited companies that are upfront about the risks and willing to guide you through the process responsibly.\n\n\nAngelica Leicht\n\n\nAngelica Leicht is senior editor for Managing Your Money, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

Thanks to their home equity, which is now near a record average of around $330,000, owners can tap into their homes to help finance any number of expenses, large or small. And there are multiple ways to do so, ranging from cash-out refinances to reverse mortgages (for homeowners 62 and older) to home equity loans.\u00a0One cost-effective home equity option now is a home equity line of credit, also known as a HELOC. HELOCs work similarly to credit cards, in the sense that you borrow as needed over time versus obtaining one lump sum. But, unlike credit cards, HELOCs come with significantly lower interest rates. And those rates are poised to drop even further as the Federal Reserve issues rate cuts, as they did in September. What would a $20,000 HELOC cost monthly, then, now that rates have been reduced? That's what we'll calculate below.Start by seeing what HELOC rate you qualify for here now.Here's what a $20,000 HELOC costs monthly now that rates were cutBefore calculating the potential costs of a HELOC, no matter the amount, it's important to remember that HELOC rates are variable, meaning that they'll change over the repayment period. While this is a major disadvantage when interest rates are climbing, it can be a big benefit now with rates on the decline again.\u00a0That said, it's difficult to predict with certainty what your HELOC rate will be in the months and years ahead, as rates will change over that time. Here's what a $20,000 HELOC costs monthly now that rates were cut, tied to two common repayment periods:10-year HELOC at 8.94%: $252.70 per month15-year HELOC at 8.94%: $202.14 per monthBut what happens if the Fed issues a rate cut of 25 basis points in November and another by the same amount in December? While HELOC rates won't directly fall by the same amounts, it's helpful to know what those payments could potentially look like if you wait. Here's what they'd be if today's rates are reduced by 25 basis points:10-year HELOC at 8.69%: $250.01 per month\u00a015-year HELOC at 8.69%: $199.18 per monthAnd here's what they'd be if HELOC rates drop by a total of 50 basis points from where they are currently:10-year HELOC at 8.44%: $247.33 per month\u00a015-year HELOC at 8.44%: $196.25 per monthSo not only are HELOCs relatively inexpensive now, but the monthly payments are likely to become even cheaper in the months to come. Still, it doesn't make sense to wait. Because HELOCs adjust independently (unlike home equity loans which will need to be refinanced), you'll automatically enjoy a lower rate when it drops. Don't hesitate to open a HELOC now.\n\n\nGet started here today.The bottom lineRight now, a HELOC comes with monthly payments between approximately $203 and $253, and those payments could potentially drop by a few dollars in the months ahead. But it's important to remember that the best HELOC rates, just like the best rates on any other borrowing product, will be reserved for those with the highest credit scores. So if your credit isn't in top shape now, you may not be offered the above rates. And remember that your home is the collateral in these borrowing circumstances so it's critical that you only withdraw an amount of home equity that you can easily afford to pay back.\n\n\nMatt Richardson\n\n\nMatt Richardson is the managing editor for the Managing Your Money section for CBSNews.com.

But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children.The District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \"unlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \"gifts\" to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn't registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok's LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \"virtual strip club\" without any age restrictions.

Discounted pricing once reserved for Black Friday and Cyber Monday is now going into effect in early October.\u00a0\"Holiday creep,\" the term for when retailers start selling holiday-themed items before the traditional start of the season, is a phenomenon that's been at play for years, as retailers try to get a jump-start on sales.\u00a0This year, given that the window between Thanksgiving and Christmas is almost one week shorter compared with last, stores will have even less time to clear merchandise from shelves and capture consumers' dollars. To make up for that time, they're hosting holiday sales events as early as the beginning of October, before the leaves have even started to fall in many places.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Wayfair is hosting its seasonal sales event, Way Day, on October 5 through October 9. Target Circle Week runs from October 6 through October 12, and Amazon Prime Big Deals Day will be held on October 8 and 9.Walmart this year\u00a0released its \"Top Toys List\" on September 9-15, to start tempting customers weeks before Santa's arrival. \"'Tis the season for toys!\" read a press release announcing the list.\u00a0\n\n\n\"It's been an ongoing retail movement over the last few years of bringing sales forward, it's 'holiday creep,' or 'Black October' \u2014 whatever you want to call it,\" said Adam Davis, managing director of Wells Fargo retail finance, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are trying to maximize sales by elongating the season to get as much share of wallet as possible.\"Getting ahead of the Black Friday crowdAnother reason for holiday creep? Limited consumer spending dollars. Most shoppers have fixed budgets, or set dollar amounts they're willing to spend on holiday merchandise and gifts. So, retailers compete with one another for consumers' precious dollars. If they've blown through their budgets before Thanksgiving arrives, stores that wait until Black Friday to reveal deals will have missed an opportunity to lure them in.\u00a0\"There's a finite budget, for the most part, of what consumers are willing to spend. And retailers want to capture their dollars earlier in the season, so they don't get caught up in the clutter of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, being one of many companies promoting deals and getting lost in the mix,\" Davis said.\u00a0In other words, consumers don't have to wait until Black Friday to look for sales on winter coats, toys and appliances.\u00a0\n\n\n\"A lot of direct-to-consumer companies are following the lead of Amazon, which has its big Prime Day coming up. They are following suit because they don't want to lose out on extra traffic from consumers,\" Davis added.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to protect yourself from holiday brushing scams\n03:44\n\nAggressive promotions start nowStill, early price cuts aren't usually as deep as those introduced around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, by which time retailers panic if they haven't sold a substantial amount of their inventory. If consumers take their chances and wait until after Christmas to start shopping, they could secure even better deals, but there's no guarantee that product will be available.\u00a0\"Retailers like to grab customers now, in early October and November, because they can sell product at higher margins than after Thanksgiving, when they're in panic mode because sales aren't there and they need to rapidly discount things,\" Davis explained.Retail expert Mark A. Cohen, former director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said that while promotional creep is as intrinsic to the holiday season as Christmas jingles, \"it does get a little bit more pronounced when the calendar shifts to compress the Thanksgiving to Christmas season.\"\"The march to a successful outcome is underway. And whereas traditionally, retailers would keep their promotional behavior under wraps and protect their gross margins, I think now they are more insecure than they have ever been and don't want to have any excess inventory coming out of holiday season,\" he said. \"So they are promoting aggressively now.\"\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Florida gas stations in these cities face fuel shortages amid Milton evacuations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A look inside Elvis Presley's black box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JetBlue drops hot meals from menu for coach passengers on transatlantic flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Americans are flocking to U.S. regions most threatened by climate change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Eitan Halley escaped Hamas' attack on the Nova festival, but not unscathed\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan Cerullo\n\n\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

Not only are they big and clunky, but they take up precious storage space in your home. If you want to reclaim a bit of that space for yourself, a small but mighty\u00a0stick vacuum may be the best solution for you.\u00a0The best stick vacuums are lightweight and cordless while still offering strong suction power. Some also come with great extra features, including multiple brush heads, a digital display that allows you to see how much battery life is left, and multi-step HEPA filtration for a deep clean -- perfect for people living with household allergies. If you have pets, a stick vacuum can even help bring down the amount of dander floating around the air.\u00a0With so many stick vacuums on the market though, it can be hard to find the right one for your home. That's why we did all the work for you and rounded up the best stick vacuums of 2024.

That means it's a capable cleaning appliance to help you tackle just about any mess you encounter.\u00a0It includes the brand's clog-reducing Jet Cyclone technology for consistent, powerful suction that stops dirt and debris from building up on the filter. It also has a telescoping tool to help you access hard-to-reach parts of your home for a more thorough clean when you can't reach it with your arms alone.\u00a0\n\n\nA turbo brush specifically conquers carpets, and a digital display keeps you abreast of the power level. That way you aren't halfway through a cleaning job and the vacuum shuts down on you. No one likes it when that happens.\u00a0In addition, its Cleaning Station can automatically empty itself with the push of a button, which means you don't have to dirty your hands trying to tackle that part yourself.\u00a0\n\n                  $400\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest budget stick vacuum: Tineco A11 Pet\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDon't let the fact that this stick vacuum is geared toward pet messes fool you. That's just one of the many things it's good at - and its budget price makes it well worth testing to see that. This unit's 450W motor makes it super easy to power through any mess, whether you're cleaning up on carpet or rugs or hardwood flooring. It also tends to target messes with hair thanks to its specially-designed brush to make it simple to clean while getting rid of the other debris it collects while running. \n\n\nWhen you operate the vacuum it will only allow cleaner air to be let out into your home, too, thanks to a four-stage filtration system that captures fine particulates in the air. That means dust and pollen, so you can expect a less allergen-laden house, especially if you do have pets.One of the most exciting aspects of this vacuum is the fact that it can be converted to a portable hand vacuum with a miniature power brush, dusting brush, and crevice tool.

If you have a dog or cat that's constantly leaving hair everywhere, you'll want to come back to this one again and again.It comes with a HEPA filtration system and an anti-allergen seal that helps trap pet dander as well as other allergens lingering on the floor. This model can be used for 40 minutes before it needs charging.\n\n\nIt doubles as a hand vacuum, so if you find smaller messes that need to be picked up but don't quite necessitate you dragging the entire vacuum out, this is a great option for that, especially for pets.\u00a0\n\n                  $230\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest corded stick vacuum: Shark Ultralight PetPro\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nThe Shark Ultralight PetPro vacuum weighs just under three pounds, making it the lightest vacuum on this entire list. It features Shark's PowerFin, plus a soft roller so you can seamlessly switch between cleaning carpets and other types of flooring.\u00a0\n\n\nThe cleaning appliance comes outfitted with powerful LED lights on the nozzle to help you locate dirt, dust and pet hair you might typically miss around your home.

It features a fifth-generation Hyperdymium motor, spinning at up to 135,000 RPM. Just to put that in perspective, most vacuum motors typically run at 10,000 RPM. A super-fast vacuum might run up to 35,000 RPM.\u00a0The vacuum features a fully sealed, whole-machine HEPA filtration system that can capture 99.99% of particles and 99.9% of viruses.\u00a0\n\n\nIt also includes a Fluffy Optic cleaner head, with a lighting system that can reveal twice the amount of microscopic dust. Dyson engineers designed the new light source to be positioned as low as possible in the endcap of the cleaner head, projecting a blade of light to illuminate particles on floors. It also features a built-in dusting and crevice tool, as well as a power button (instead of the classic trigger).\u00a0The Gen5detect offers up to 70 minutes of suction and a new user interface that can show you when your surface is clean.

You should consider a few important things first. Check out the kinds of floors in your home. Are they mostly hardwood? Low-pile carpet? Tile? You need to buy a vacuum based on what you'll be cleaning regularly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, consider your home's size and layout. If you have a larger house, look for a vacuum with a long runtime or cord to avoid constant recharging. Pet hair? Get a model with specialized brushes and powerful suction to clean it all up quickly.You'll also need to decide between corded and cordless. Corded vacuums deliver consistent power, great for big cleans. But the cord limits your reach. Cordless models mean you can move from room to room without having to unplug and replug the power cord. Just be aware runtime depends on battery life, which is also something important to look into. Some only last for about an hour, while others can run well past 120 minutes.\n\n\nOf course, suction power is also key. Check the motor wattage and suction ratings. Strong suction gobbles up dirt, dust and debris. For allergy sufferers, look for advanced filtration like HEPA to trap tiny particles and keep the air in your home as clean as possible.\nBrittany Vincent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrittany Vincent has been covering gaming, tech, and all things entertainment for 16 years for a variety of online and print publications.

Hands-on review", "Author": "Leslie Gornstein", "Date": "September 27, 2024 / 5:20 PM EDT", "content": "\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nApple just released its latest lineup of iPhones, which include the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, but when comparing these new phones to last year's models, the updates seem a bit lackluster -- offering just small improvements and a handful of promises.Having owned every iPhone model since the original was released in 2007, I've always been one of the early-adopters and have purchased the latest model as soon as Apple begins accepting preorders. This year was no different. I preordered the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 512GB of internal storage in the new desert titanium color. It replaced my iPhone 15 Pro Max, also with 512GB of storage.\u00a0Keep reading to learn more about this phone and whether it's worth upgrading, or if you should stick with the iPhone model you're currently using.Pro Tip: If you're thinking about making the switch from an\u00a0Android phone to an iPhone 16, we've got you covered with our coverage of five reasons to make the transition.\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \n\n\n\nWho should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max?\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in four new colors, with a housing made from titanium.\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple's top-of-the-line smartphone and the model with the largest display. It's designed for those who need the fastest performance possible, and who can benefit from having the largest smartphone display that Apple has to offer. This smartphone is designed to be a high-performance communications device that can also serve as a productivity, entertainment, health/fitness and safety tool, as well as a powerful still image and video camera.This is the iPhone you want if you're interested in taking pro-quality photos or shooting video at up to 4K (120fps) resolution. Thanks to its Apple A18 Pro processor, it's also the model that can handle high-end gaming or tasks that require a tremendous amount of processing power.\u00a0\n\n\nUnless you need both the added processing power of the A18 Pro chip (that's available in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) and want the additional on-screen real estate offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, one of Apple's less expensive iPhones may be more suitable for you.iPhone 16 Pro Max: At a glance\n\n\n            \n                Jason R.

The CPU is up to 15% faster, while the GPU runs up to 20% faster. That said, being a \"power user,\" when working with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I never once thought to myself, \"Gee, this smartphone is too slow,\" nor did I ever become frustrated by any unwanted lagging -- even when playing high-end, graphic-intensive games. This makes me wonder if even more processing power is worth the investment.\n\n\nThe phone also now supports Wi-Fi 7, as opposed to Wi-Fi 6E. And battery life is more efficient, compared to last year's model. You can expect up to four additional hours of runtime per charge.\u00a0\nThe new Camera Control button is located on the side of the iPhone 16 phones.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \nThe two significant new features are the Camera Control button that's located on the side of the smartphone, as well as the Apple Intelligence (AI) integration that will soon be part of a yet-to-be-released version of iOS 18. This AI functionality is expected to be released later this fall. The only users who will benefit from the Camera Control button are those who heavily use their iPhone to take photos or shoot video -- and even then, using the Camera Control button is optional.\n\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max's housing is now made using Grade 5 titanium, which is lightweight and incredibly durable. Plus, to make the display slightly larger than last year's model, Apple has decreased the size of the bezel around the screen. This allows for a 6.9-inch display, compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.6-inch display. This display size difference is inconsequential.\u00a0\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \nWill Apple Intelligence make the iPhone smarter?At the moment, that's a difficult question to answer, since Apple Intelligence will not be introduced into any iPhones until later this fall. However, what we expect is a more personalized Siri digital assistant that not only understands what's being said, but also the context that's used when making requests or asking questions.\u00a0\n\n\nApple Intelligence will allow apps to more seamlessly work together and exchange relevant information in a way that can streamline common tasks, while helping users maintain their privacy and security. Apple Intelligence will also help with composing text. When used as an audio recording device, it will be able to transcribe and then summarize recordings. AI-assisted language translations and more seamless scheduling and to-do list management have also been promised.For someone who takes a lot of pictures or shoots video, Apple Intelligence introduces easier to use and more powerful image enhancement and editing tools, such as the Clean Up feature offered by the Photos app that can be used to remove unwanted objects from photos. This feature works decently, but only in certain situations. AI can also assist in the actual picture taking or video shooting process to ensure the best possible results. However, until Apple actually unlocks all of the Apple Intelligence features, it's difficult to predict how useful the AI-driven functionality will actually be.\n\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Photography and videography\n\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \nFrom a hardware standpoint, the improvements made to the iPhone 16 Pro Max's camera system aren't dramatic. However, Apple has made major enhancements to both the Camera and Photos apps that come preinstalled with iOS 18. This gives the camera system new capabilities. Combined with the faster processor, overall camera performance is noticeably better. There are also more tools for taking, editing, enhancing, organizing and sharing photos and video content.Most noticeable is the addition of the Camera Control button. This physical button on the side of the phone can be used to quickly launch the Camera app, adjust the app's settings, and then work as a shutter button. The result is an experience that's closer to using a traditional point-and-shoot camera than ever before. Of course, all of the camera controls and options previously available via the touchscreen continue to be offered. Thus, the Camera Control button provides an alternative and optional way to work with the Camera app.\n\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is now able to shoot video at 4K (120fps) resolution with support for Dolby Vision. This is the highest resolution and frame rate an iPhone has ever offered. This is combined with enhanced spatial audio recording capabilities when shooting video, so it's easier to capture and create more immersive and visually compelling content.The still photography options are also enhanced. There are two upgraded 48MP cameras and one 12MP camera on the back of the phone, which support both the ProRAW and HEIF photo file formats. This allows users to capture a higher level of detail, even in low light situations. Using digital zoom capabilities, you now get up to 25x zoom. The phone's macro (extreme close-up) capabilities have been enhanced, too.\n\n\nThe behind-the-scenes processing that happens when shooting photos or video allows the phone to capture more accurate colors, including more life-like skin tones. And with the help of Photographic Styles, it's easier to infuse your own creativity when creating content.The redesign of the Photos app offers more features and control over the stored images. However, the redesigned interface is not as intuitive as it once was. It's different enough that it's been taking me time to acclimate to the new design (and I have been using the beta version of iOS 18 on the iPhone 15 Pro Max for over a month already). I fear some users will find the new interface downright confusing.\n\n\nSample images taken using the iPhone 16 Pro Max\nThis is an example of the customizable Photographic Styles now offered by the Camera app.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nUsing the Macro and Portrait shooting mode together, you get customizable control over an images depth of field.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThe 48MP Fusion camera on of the back of the iPhone does a nice job capturing wide shows with vibrant color.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nUsers now get more creative control when transforming a full-color image into black and white.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max does an excellent job capturing detail using the Macro shooting mode.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n\nThis is an example of the new Clean Up feature in the Photos app that allows you to quickly remove unwanted objects from images. I found this feature works adequately, but I've had better results using the Heal tool in third-party apps, like Photoshop Express and TouchRetouch.\n\n            \n                Jason R. Rich\n\n                          \n5 differences between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\n\n            \n                Jason R Rich\n\n                          \nThe iPhone 16 offers a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max features a 6.9-inch display.The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus run using the Apple 18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are equipped with the faster and more powerful A18 Pro chip.The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of internal storage, while the iPhone 16 offers 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of internal storage (with no 1TB option).The resolution of the iPhone 16 is lower than what's offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max -- 2,556 x 1,179 pixels versus 2,868 x 1,320 pixels.The iPhone 16 offers two rear-facing cameras, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has three rear-facing cameras, so users get more creative control and option when taking pictures or filming video.Is the iPhone 16 Pro Max worth it?The best way to see how well the iPhone 16 Pro Max performs, outside of photography or videography, is to push its processing power by playing graphic-intensive games. I installed and played \"Diabolo Immortal.\" Visually, this is one of the more advanced iPhone games available from the App Store, and it looks and sounds fantastic on this phone.\u00a0\n\n\n            \n                Diablo Immortal\n\n                          \nAnother new thing is the ability to further customize the appearance of what appears on the iPhone's screen. For savvy users, these added features are fun to work with. However, for someone who's already overwhelmed by all of the iPhone's customizable options, navigating through the Settings app and personalizing the phone is now a more convoluted process.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd love to say that anyone who is using an older iPhone or Android phone should switch to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I am not comfortable making this claim. Instead, I'd certainly recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max to anyone who is using an iPhone that's three or more years old. These people who will see the greatest improvement in overall performance, especially if they want a larger screen, too.However, if you're an iPhone 15 Pro Max user thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the only significant enhancement is the addition of the Camera Control button, since both phones can run the latest version of iOS 18 and will take advantage of Apple Intelligence once it's released.\u00a0Design: With the exception of the additional Camera Control button and slightly larger display, the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is very similar to last year's model. I do really like the new and more sophisticated looking casing color options, however.Performance: Yes, the iPhone 16 Pro Max can perform faster. This will potentially be beneficial when using Apple Intelligence functionality, but for everyday tasks, it makes little difference.Value: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expensive. Unless you need the extra processing power and larger display, you can save money upgrading to the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Plus is a middle option, but for slightly more money, most users will appreciate the enhanced performance of the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max.AI integration: The NPU is certainly powerful, but how well Apple integrates Apple Intelligence into iOS 18 and core apps is yet to be seen.\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from AT&T\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Verizon\n      \n\n\n          Order the iPhone 16 Pro Max from Best Buy\n      \n\n\n\nFor in-depth reviews of the Apple iPhone 16 Pro,\u00a0Google Pixel 9,\u00a0Google Pixel 9 Pro,\u00a0Google Pixel 9 Pro XL,\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6,\u00a0Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,\u00a0OnePlus 12\u00a0and other popular phones, check out our ever-expanding\u00a0tech coverage.In:\n          Apple\nSmartphone\niPhone\n\nJason R.

It offers excellent heat retention, a one-touch cleaning system, a thermometer built into the lid and durable steel construction. The grill is also available in your choice of copper, black or green.\u00a0Enjoy 363 square inches of premium cooking space from this 22-inch grill.\u00a0 This is enough space to prepare 13 burgers at once. It offers a porcelain-enameled bowl and lid, along with a plated steel-hinged cooking grate. The lid height is 7.5 inches.\n\n\nAs you're cooking, the charcoal ash falls into a high-capacity catcher tray that's easily removable when it needs to be emptied. Without even having to lift the lid, you can control the grill's temperature by adjusting its dampers. When you close the dampers completely, this cuts off oxygen flow and extinguishes the coals. And the lid's handle has a built-in heat shield that keeps it from getting too hot.\u00a0Between its classic design, durability and ease of use, you can't go wrong with this Original Kettle Premium grill from Weber. And it's offered at a great price, too.\n\n                  $239\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest portable charcoal\u00a0grill: Cuisinart CCG-190\n\n\n            \n                Cuisinart\n\n                          \nThe biggest benefit of this charcoal grill is that it can be set up virtually anywhere outdoors, so you can take it on a camping trip, set it up at a tailgate party, park it on a patio, or tuck it onto a deck.The entire unit measures just 14.5 x 14.5 x 15 inches and weighs a mere two pounds. To keep everything together during transport, it has three built-in lid locks. The grill also includes an ash catcher and a dual venting system.\n\n\nThis Cuisinart grill is available in black with a red cover or all black. For cooking space, there's a full 196 square inches. And the cooking rack is chrome-plated, so it helps to distribute heat more evenly.\u00a0A slightly larger model is also available ($36). It offers the same design, but 200 square inches of cooking space.\n\n                  $24\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest value charcoal grill: Royal Gourmet CC1830\n\n\n            \n                Royal Gourmet\n\n                          \nThis charcoal grill from Royal Gourmet is certainly not the least expensive on the market, but its mere $100 price tag makes it a really good value. It'll make an excellent addition to your backyard space.The grill offers a primary 443-square-inch cooking space that uses a porcelain-enameled steel wire cooking grate. This is accompanied by an 184-square-inch, chrome-plated steel wire warming rack. When you're done cooking, simply close the lid and the side air vent to extinguish the coals faster. The removable charcoal pan makes ash disposal easy.\n\n\nThe Royal Gourmet CC1830 has a six-pound charcoal capacity and a two-level height-adjustable fire pan. The bottom shelf that's built into the unit can hold up to 20 pounds. There's also a built-in side tablet that provides some extra space for food prep.You can opt to purchase the grill on its own, or for $128, you'll get the grill and a complete 13-piece grilling set as a bundle.\n\n                  $100\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest charcoal grill for large groups: Royal Gourmet CC2036F\n\n\n            \n                Royal Gourmet\n\n                          \nFrom the popular Royal Gourmet CC2036F charcoal grill, you get a vast 1,200 square inches of total cooking space, which makes preparing food for a large group a breeze. In addition to offering a classic barrel grill design, this model includes a smoker, which provides added cooking options.\u00a0 All of the cooking grates are made from porcelain-enameled steel wire.\n\n\nThe grill is primarily constructed from alloy steel. It measures 29.92 x 65.94 x 51.18 inches and weighs 87.5 pounds. Built into the base are two wheels, which makes positioning the grill easier.\u00a0Once this grill heats up, it'll be ready to prepare food for eight to 10 people at once. The 1,200 square inches of cooking space is divided into three areas -- a 668-square-inch primary cooking space, a 260-square-inch warming rack and a 272-square-inch offset smoker. The smoker attaches to the main body of the grill.\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary cooking area takes advantage of a three-level adjustable charcoal pan, which can hold up to 7.7 pounds of charcoal. The smoker unit holds up to 2.6 pounds of charcoal. When it comes to quick cleanup, the grill has a grease drip cup and a removable charcoal pan. Built into the grill's lid is a handy thermometer.\u00a0\n\n                  $229\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nBest kamado charcoal grill: NewAge Products Platinum 22\" kamado grill\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nThis premium-quality kamado charcoal grill is a must have for any backyard. It provides the ultimate grilling experience, while capturing that unique taste that only this type of grill can provide.\u00a0\n\n\nThanks to its 22-inch diameter, the grill gives you an impressive 450 square inches of cooking space. You get full control over temperature, too. It's able to maintain an accurate and even temperature between 225 degrees and 750 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0This grill is available in three finishes. It comes with everything you need to enjoy a robust grilling experience, no matter what types of foods you're preparing. Along with the grill itself, you get an expander grate, a hang cooking set, a grate griller, a charcoal chimney starter, a charcoal tray and a charcoal zone divider. A stainless steel stand, created just for this grill, is sold separately.\u00a0\n\n\nWe adore this grill's features. It has a solid ceramic firebox that's complemented with natural teak handles. In other words, the Platinum Kamado is built for durability, heat retention and even heat distribution. You also get 8 millimeter stainless steel grates.\u00a0Another notable feature is that the grill comes with a patent-pending ash bucket. It collects almost all the ash. So, once the kamado is cool to the touch, you can easily lift it up and dump the ash. This makes clean-up a breeze.\n\n                  $1,300\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nBest premium charcoal grill:\u00a0Kamado Joe Classic III\n\n\n            \n                Kamado Joe\n\n                          \nIf you're looking for a charcoal grill that not only makes a bold visual statement but also offers a ton of useful features, we recommend the Kamado Joe Classic III charcoal grill. It comes in a blaze-red color with black accents and measures 24 x 42 x 41.98 inches.\u00a0When you open the lid, you'll discover an 18-inch-wide, circular ceramic cooking grate. The grill's base is made from heavy-duty galvanized steel and has a rolling cart design with locking wheels.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the most interesting things about this grill is that it offers a patent-pending design that creates a hyperbolic smoke chamber. In other words, Harvard science transforms the Kamado Joe grill into one of the world's best smokers. By distributing smoke and heat in rolling, recirculating waves, the cooking chamber surrounds food in clouds of delicious smoke, while evenly distributing heat. This results in enhanced flavor, with significantly reduced hot spots.This grill is also equipped with a handy, multi-level, half-moon design that allows you to cook different foods in different styles at different temperatures -- at the same time. The top vent helps you maintain a consistent air setting for precise airflow management during dome opening and closing.\u00a0\n\n\nWe love that the Classic III is constructed of powder-coated cast aluminum. The dual-adjustment top vent is rain- and mold-resistant. It allows you to smoke from 225 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. So while you'll pay more for this premium grill, what you get for your investment is added flavor, versatility, durability and efficiency.\n\n                  $1,900\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nHow to choose a charcoal grillWith so many options when it comes to charcoal grills, here are five things to consider:\u00a0Overall size: Based on the size of your yard, patio or porch, make sure your grill will fit safely within that space, without posing a fire risk if it's set up too close to your home, decking, or overhanging trees.Cooking space: This impacts how much food you can make at once. Keep in mind that some grill brands include the warming rack in their calculations for overall cooking space. For a family of four, 400 to 500 square inches of cooking space is enough. For eight to 10 people, you'll want 650 and 800 square inches of primary cooking space. A wider cooking space is best for preparing a rack of ribs. If you plan to grill a large turkey, also pay attention to the height of the cooking space.Grill grates: Most grill grates are made from stainless steel, porcelain enameled cast iron, or porcelain enameled steel. All of these options are durable and easy to clean. When cooking steak, these grate materials create impressive sear marks.Materials and durability: For the main housing of a charcoal grill, you want a durable material that retains heat well. Stainless steel, cast iron, enamel or sheet metal are the most common options. Out of these, stainless steel is the strongest material. It can withstand outdoor conditions the best.Ease of cleanup: Charcoal dust and grease can make a mess. Get a grill that offers a design and uses materials that are easy to clean, but be sure to follow the cleaning directions in the owner's manual to prevent damage to the grill or the possibility of mixing harmful chemicals into your food.\nJason R.

It's an entry-level\u00a0action camera\u00a0that can serve as either a point-and-shoot still-image camera or versatile video camera.

It's also waterproof down to 16 feet and features a long-lasting rechargeable battery\n\n\nThere are more than 35 GoPro mounts and accessories available for this camera, but it works nicely on its own, with a handheld grip, or a tabletop tripod (such the\u00a0GoPro Shorty,\u00a0The Handler\u00a0or\u00a0GoPro 3-Way 2.0). A\u00a0microSD memory card\u00a0is also required and sold separately.The GoPro Hero features a 1.76-inch, full-color, LCD touchscreen on the back and it can operate in temperatures between 14 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0\n\n                  $200\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nA gift that goes airbore: DJI Neo\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor beginner drone pilots of all ages, the new DJI Neo can be controlled using any smartphone or the optional DJI handheld controller. Neo is a feature-packed, but ultra-small and light drawn that sets up in seconds and is incredibly easy to fly. It even comes with three rechargeable battery packs (and the charger), but each battery only lasts for around 15 minutes of flying time.What we absolutely love about this drone is that it can takeoff and land from the palm of a hand. It has automatic stabilization (even in slightly windy conditions) and the Neo is able to capture gorgeous 4K resolution video using it's built in camera.\n\n\nThanks to the full-coverage propeller guards, the Neo can withstand minor crashes and won't accidentally harm a user's fingers. Don't be fooled by this drone's size or price, it's definitely not a toy. It is, however, easy enough for anyone over the age of 10 to fly. The smartphone app for the Neo offers integrated flying modes that can be activated with the touch of an on-screen icon, but it also responds to voice commands given via a phone. Our in-house tech gurus tested out this drone and had a blast flying it, so we know whomever you gift it to will love it.\n\n                  $199\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nPerfect for the mobile gamer: Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition\n\n\n            \n                Nintendo\n\n                          \nThe Nintendo Switch Lite runs virtually all of the most popular Switch games (except for those that require a Joy-Con controller).

It addition to a sleek and thin design, the laptop's exterior was inspired by nature. And thanks to it's competitive price, it makes a excellent gift.For starters, the S 16 is a mere 0.43 inches thick when shut. And the laptop offers a smooth and simple appearance that relies on a durable and water resistant outer housing that's made from Ceraluminum -- a fusion of ceramic and aluminum that's widely used in the aerospace industry.\n\n\nSure, the Zenbook S 16 looks beautiful on the outside, but it's the inner workings of this laptop that make it to stand out. One highlight is its 16-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits maximum brightness. The laptop is powered using an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor with a dedicated AI NPU. And for graphics, you get a AMD Radeon 880m GPU.Combine this with 24GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for internal storage, along with a quick-charging battery, and the result is a powerful and versatile Windows laptop. The internal six speaker system was co-designed by Harman Kardon. For video calling and other tasks, the Zenbook S 16 has a built-in, 1080p resolution webcam. Plus, the laptop is chock full of ports.\u00a0\n\n\nEven without using the Copilot + PC AI capabilities, this is a standout laptop. However, when you start using the AI, this greatly expands how the laptop can be used, for tasks like texting, transcribing audio recordings, doing in-depth research, organizing a schedule, making content creation easier, and so much more. The latest AI functionality is just one keypress away, thanks to the Copilot key on its backlit keyboard. All this computing power is packaged in a laptop that costs just $1,200.\u00a0\n\n                  $1,200\n            at\n      Best Buy\n      \nFor kids and tweens who want an iPad: Apple iPad (9th Generation)\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nRight now, you can get a brand-new, Wi-Fi-only\u00a0Apple iPad (9th Generation) tablet\u00a0with 64GB of internal storage for just $199 at Amazon, which is an incredible deal, making it a great time to grab someone an amazing gift.\n\n\nThe iPad (9th Generation) boasts more than 67,500 customer reviews on Amazon and has earned 4.8 stars out of five, so you know people love it. It's the perfect starter\u00a0tablet for kids and teens, or anyone who wants the capabilities of an iPad without paying top dollar for an\u00a0Apple iPad Pro\u00a0or iPad Air.The ninth-generation iPad tablet isn't the latest model. It features the slightly older Apple A13 Bionic processor, but it does run the same version of iPadOS and includes the full suite of apps available on the current iPad models. This tablet is equipped with a 10.2 inch (2,160 by 1,620-pixel resolution) Retina touchscreen display, along with a 12MP front camera and 8MP rear camera. The battery lasts for about 10 hours per charge. Choose between a space gray or silver casing color.\n\n                  $199\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor avid readers on the move: Boox Palma e-reader\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor people who enjoy reading, there are a bunch of really great e-readers from brands like Amazon, Kobo and Boox that offer lightweight devices that are waterproof and easy to view in almost any lighting situation. Some even have full-color, digital ink displays.However the Boox Palma is the only truly hand-held e-reader. It's about the same size as a typical smartphone, but instead of an OLED display, it relies on a digital ink display that's easy on the eyes. In addition to fitting in the palm of a hand or pocket and being waterproof, what readers love about the Palma is that it offers distraction-free reading.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen paired with Bluetooth headphones or earbuds, the Palma also works as an audiobook and podcast player. Plus, it can serve as a simple device that displays and manages personalized information thanks to optional widgets.The 6.13-inch digital ink touchscreen display offers 824 x 1,648 pixel (300 pixels-per-inch) resolution. It comes with 128GB of internal storage, which is enough to hold thousands of e-books or hundreds of audiobooks. More storage can be added by inserting an optional microSD memory card.\u00a0\n\n\nOne other notable feature is that the device relies on the Android 11 operating system, so optional apps can be downloaded and installed via the Google Play Store. However, the Palma is not suitable for displaying video or detailed photographs. It is mainly designed to make text very easy to read, without causing eye fatigue during long reading sessions.For someone who wants a truly compact e-reader, the Palma measures just 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.31 inches and weighs a mere 6 ounces. The rechargeable battery lasts for several weeks.\n\n                  $280\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor Chromebook fans who want AI: Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3\n\n\n            \n                Lenovo\n\n                          \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro tablet is a popular, two-in-one device that runs Windows 11 with Copilot+ PC functionality. It can serve as a versatile tablet which the user can write on using a stylus, or it can be used as a laptop when a detachable keyboard is added. The problem: This device is expensive (priced around $1,000 without the keyboard).For someone who would benefit from a powerful, lightweight and versatile device that comes with a keyboard, and that's priced starting at just $280, there's the Lenovo Duet 3. This two-in-one device is a Chromebook, which means it runs using the ChromeOS operating system (not Windows) and relies heavily on cloud applications and storage.\n\n\nThe Duet 3 features an 11-inch touchscreen display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 400 nits. It's a great option for budget-conscious adults, but is also nicely equipped for elementary or middle school students. And it supports the latest Google Gemini AI tools and features. Battery life is up to 12 hours.\u00a0People love the Duet 3 because it weighs just 1.14 pounds and is water-resistant. It also has a stereo speaker system, a front- and rear-facing camera, as well as two USB Type-C ports. In other words, you get an impressive amount of computing power at a very affordable price.\u00a0\n\n\nBe sure to check out our 2024 Chromebook Plus buyer's guide\u00a0for more information about the latest Chromebook laptops and what they offer.\n\n                  $280 and up\n            at\n      Lenovo\n      \nFor enjoying music and more: Apple AirPods Pro 2\n\n\n            \n                Apple\n\n                          \nApple AirPods Pro 2 are currently the top-of-the-line wireless earbuds in Apple's lineup. Out of the three options, this is the model we recommend the most highly because it integrates more features that enable the earbuds to produce significantly better sound quality and overall performance. Its wireless charge case supports USB-C charging. These wireless earbuds have also been approved by the FDA to serve as\u00a0over-the-counter hearting aids.\n\n\nWith these earbuds, you get additional features like adaptive audio, active noise cancellation, a transparency mode, a conversation awareness feature and onboard touch controls. Not to be confused with the lower-end AirPods 4, the AirPods Pro 2 use Apple's next-generation H2 headphone chip. The dust, sweat and waterproof rating of the AirPods Pro 2 is IP54, which makes them a bit more durable for those looking for\u00a0earbuds for the gym.The good news is that while their suggested retail price is $249, we've seen them regularly go on sale.\n\n\nIf you're confused about which version of the popular Apple AirPods is best suited to the person you're seeking a gift for, our team of consumer technology experts has written an\u00a0AirPods buyer's guide for 2024\u00a0that'll help you make the right choice.\n\n                  $183\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor someone who cares for their lawn: Mammotion Luba 2 AWD 1000\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nLike many of the\u00a0newest robotic lawn mowers, this one does not require a perimeter cable. For precision navigation, it relies on GPS, RTK and built-in 3D cameras, along with data provided by its mobile app. This allows for quick initial setup and the ability to create virtual boundaries with multiple zones.\u00a0\n\n\nUsing the app, the user can easily set up different mowing tasks for multiple work areas. This includes setting separate schedules, cutting modes and cutting heights for each zone. It handles slopes as easily as flat terrain thanks to \"off-road\" tires and suspension. Meanwhile, its internal cameras have a 220-degree field of view, which gives it excellent obstacle-avoidance capabilities. It can detect and avoid items as small as two inches.\u00a0One fun feature that sets the Luba 2 AWD 1000 apart from its competition is that it can -- and you're reading this right --\u00a0create lawn art. From the mobile app, you can choose different patterns or create custom designs. The mower uses advanced algorithms to adjust the cutting height and angle to recreate the pattern in your lawn.\u00a0\n\n\nThe mower cuts grass and handles edge cutting with extreme precision, in part because of its internal technologies. On a fully charged battery, it operates for up to two hours before automatically returning to its charging dock. Since it offers an IPX6 waterproof rating, you can easily clean it with a garden hose. Other versions of the Luba 2 can handle larger lawns (up to 2.5 acres). This is not the least expensive robot mower available, but based on its performance, technology and overall quality, the Luba 2 AWD 1000 offers a really good value for the investment. It's a great gift for anyone who does not enjoy manually mowing their lawn using a traditional push mower.\n\n                  $2,499\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor the avid PC Gamer: Dell UltraSharp 40 curved Thunderbolt Hub monitor\n\n\n            \n                Dell\n\n                          \nOne of the ways PC gamers are able to immerse themselves in the virtual worlds they choose to experience is through the use of a high-resolution, curved monitor.

So, whether it's used for gaming, content creation, or other types of work, this monitor can do it all -- and do it well.

However, back in 2016, the company dropped out of the television market -- that is, until now. In September, Panasonic re-entered the television marketplace with several high-end TV models with specifications and features that rival what the current bestselling TVs offer.The new Panasonic Z95 series TV comes in a handful of screen sizes, including this popular 65-inch model. It's equipped with a 4K OLED display with an extremely fast 144Hz refresh rate. It also provides Dolby Vision IQ, HLG and HDR10+ support. What this means is that the TV is able to showcase live sports, action movies and game content -- presenting it using an incredibly smooth, fluid, color-accurate and detailed picture.\n\n\nThis TV's built in, seven channel speaker system feature 360-degree Soundscape Pro audio tuned by Technics. This relies on integrated front-array, upward and side-firing speakers with Dolby Atmos support. And for gamers, the Z95A offers VRR, AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync support. Because this Panasonic TV is powered using the popular Amazon FireTV OS, it performs nicely as an all-in-one entertainment system that comes with a voice remote control and support for the Amazon Alexa digital assistant.Anyone who wants a new TV with cutting-edge features from a premium brand will appreciate receiving the new Panasonic Z95A as a gift this holiday season. The TV offers a great reason to splurge on a gift for someone you love -- that the entire family will enjoy for years to come.\n\n                  $3,000\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor coffee lovers: Bruvi Brewer smart coffee maker\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nYou're probably familiar with K-Cup coffee pods. Well, the Bruvi Brewer is a single-serve coffee making system that uses B-Pods.This coffee maker has a built in water filter. It's also Wi-Fi enabled, so you can pair it with your smartphone to control, personalize and monitor the coffee brewing process. The Bruvi offers variety when it comes to hot or cold beverage making. It prepares coffee, high-pressure espresso, Americanos, cold brew, iced coffee, infused coffee and tea.\n\n\nUse the Bruvi mobile app to brew remotely from your phone, schedule brews in advance, auto re-order B-Pods and access a personalized consumption dashboard. The Bruvi bundle includes the brewer itself, a variety pack of 20 B-Pods and a replaceable water filter. The built in tank holds up to 70 ounces of water.One standout feature is that the coffee goes straight to your mug, without touching the insides of the brewer. This allows for a more hygienic brew, with no flavor cross-contamination and no daily rising required. The pods come in packages of 24 and are available in a wide range of flavors and types. Keep in mind, K-Cup pods and B-Pods are not cross-compatible. This brewer only uses the company's own pods.\n\n                  $348\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor watching movies on any wall: Yaber T2 Plus indoor/outdoor projector\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIt a tech-oriented world that's now filled with ultra-large screen TV options, there's a more budget-friendly way to enjoy TV shows, movies, games and more -- indoors or outdoors -- on a projection screen that's up to 120-inches. The Yaber T2 Plus is a portable, 1080p resolution projector that can be plugged into an external power source or operated using an internal rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 2.5 hours.This projector offers a maximum brightness of 450 lumens, so it provides a decently bright and crisp picture, even if the viewing area is not totally dark. The projector's internal JBL stereo speakers support Dolby sound. One other notable feature is that the projector offers a 1.25:1 throw ratio. Combine this with an aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9, and 50 percent zoom, and you get a customizable viewing experience.\n\n\nThe T2 does not offer smart TV functionality, but it's easy to plug a Google Chromecast TV stick or streaming dongle (sold separately) into the projector's USB port. We like that the projector has a built in handle and weighs just 8.7 pounds.\u00a0\n\n                  $360\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n Wireless earbuds for audiophiles: Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 \n\n\n            \n                Bowers & Wilkins\n\n                          \nA new design, enhanced technology and Bowers & Wilkins' audio expertise combine once again to offer premium, ergonomically designed wireless earbuds that are able to provide better high-frequency detail and capture every detail in your music.

However, the Oiiwak 15-inch Triple Portable Monitor takes that concept a step further.\u00a0 \n\n\nThis portable monitor setup is compatible with most MacBook or Windows PC laptops that have a screen between 13 and 15-inches.

This single unit allows someone to connect two additional 15-inch, 1080p resolution monitors (with a 60Hz refresh rate) to their laptop using a convenient and easy to set up mounting system. The two additional monitors fold up as a single unit for easy transport. Attaching them to the back of a laptop computer's existing monitor using the all metal mounting system takes just a minute or two. Each monitor then connects to the computer using a separate USB Type-C cable. Thanks to plug-and-play technology, no special drivers or software is required. \n\n                  $800\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For gamers and computer users who like color: SteelSeries Apex Pro HyperMagnetic Gaming Keyboard \n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIf there's a gamer on your holiday gift list, giving them a popular and feature-packed, full-size gaming keyboard with integrated RGB lighting will take their PC gaming to the next level. Not only does this keyboard offer a really fast response rate, it also has a small, built in OLED display in the top-right corner that displays the computer and keyboard's current settings and status. This SteelSeries Apex Pro gaming keyboard uses OmniPoint 2.0 adjustable HyperMagnetic switches and offers 20x faster actuation and 11x faster response that a traditional mechanical keyboard. In fact, the user can choose between 40 levels of per-key actuation and utilize 2-in-1 action keys to fully customize their gaming experiences based on the game they're playing.\u00a0 \n\n\nThis is a well made, nicely designed, 104-key gaming keyboard that comes with a detachable wrist rest. The programmable RGB lighting offers a really nice visual element. The keyboard is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Xbox and PlayStation. It offers all of the key features a gamer could want from a keyboard and it makes a really sweet gift. \n\n                  $168\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor any laptop computer user: Espresso Display 17 Pro portable monitor\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nFor anyone who spends a lot of time working on their laptop computer, the Espresso 17 Pro portable monitor provides one important feature -- it can double a computer's onscreen real estate. This can allow the user to be more productive and more easily multitask.\u00a0 \n\n\nIts 17.3-inch touchscreen display offers 4K or 1080p resolution with a 60Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 440 nits. It also works with any Windows laptop or MacBook. It's a plug-and-play monitor that has built-in speakers and two USB Type-C ports. The monitor takes just seconds to set up (with no special software or drivers required) and it's powered using a single USB Type-C cable that connects to the computer. Since it's a touchscreen, the Espresso portable monitor works with a stylus too.\u00a0 There are several key features that set the Espresso portable monitor apart from others. It's lightweight (2.4 pounds) and thin (just 0.35 inches). It also comes with a screen protector for use when traveling. Plus, it has an optional adjustable stand that attaches to the back of the monitor using magnets, making it one of the very few portable monitors with height and viewing angle adjustability. We highly recommend getting this monitor and optional stand together, so it can accommodate anyone's work habits. The monitor can be used in landscape or portrait mode, which expands its versatility. Oh, and this portable monitor can be used with most smartphones and gaming consoles too. \n\n\nThe slightly scaled-down and more affordable Espresso 15-inch portable display ($499) is also available and is ideal for someone who doesn't need 4K resolution or a 17-inch screen with them when on the go. For anyone who needs a portable monitor, this one offers just about every key feature someone could want. It offers 4K resolution, uses touchscreen technology with stylus support and can display 16.2 million colors. \n\n                  $799\n            at\n      Espresso Displays\n      \n For an avid reader who wants a color display: Kobo Clara Colour\n\n\n            \n                Rakuten\n\n                          \nFor the price, the Kobo Clara Colour is one of the best e-reader deals right now, mainly because it can do everything a typical Amazon Kindle can do, but it also offers a full-color digital ink display. This makes it particularly useful for reading e-books that contain color, as well as graphic novels, and the digital editions of magazines and newspapers.\n\n\nThis e-reader offers a six inch, glare-free display. The unit itself is lightweight and easy to hold in your hands during extended reading sessions. Unlike a traditional tablet, the full-color display on this e-reader features a soothing color palette and offers a built-in highlighter feature, so you can choose a highlight color and mark up books or digital publications as you're reading.We're also fans of the Kobo Clara Colour because it's waterproof. You can take it into the bathtub or read while sunbathing at a pool or beach and never have to worry about getting the device wet. E-books, digital publications and audiobooks can be purchased from the\u00a0Kobo e-bookstore, which offers a very similar selection as the Kindle e-bookstore. The e-reader also supports OverDrive and Libby, so you can borrow e-books and audiobooks from your local public library for free.\u00a0\n\n\nFor avid readers or people who love listening to audiobooks, Rakuten offers the Kobo Plus Read ($7.99 per month), Kobo Plus Listen ($7.99 per month), and Kobo Plus Read & Listen ($9.99 per month) services. Kobo Plus Read gives you unlimited access to more than 1.5 million e-books, while the Kobo Plus Listen plan offers unlimited access to more than 150,000 audiobooks. The Kobo Plus Read & Listen plan offers access to both services at a deeply discounted rate.\n\n                  $150\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \nFor someone who wants to record memories: DJI Osmo Pocket 3\n\n\n            \n                DJI\n\n                          \nIn some ways, the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 camera resembles an action camera, but that's not it's intended purpose. It's not waterproof or incredibly durable, but it is perfect for someone who wants to carry around a tiny and versatile 4K video camera that's perfect for capturing family video, vacation video, vlogging or live streaming. \n\n\nThe Pocket 3 features a tiny camera that's mounted on a three-axis gimbal, so any video that's recorded will look incredibly smooth. Thanks to its one-inch CMOS sensor, this camera is able to record 4K video at up to 120fps. The Osmo Pocket 3 also takes still images. The camera itself has a two-inch OLED color touchscreen that rotates. This screen features a maximum brightness of 700 nits, so it's easy to see in sunlight. Not only is this camera incredibly easy to operate, thanks to its intuitive user interface, but the photos and video content it's able to capture and store on a microSD memory card are visually stunning and detailed. The entire camera weighs less than 6.4 ounces and easily fits in a hand or in a pocket when it's not being used.\u00a0 \n\n\nIf you're looking for a more durable action camera from DJI, you can't go wrong with the new DJI Osmo Action 5 ($349). This is an excellent alternative to a GoPro camera that's loaded with features that outdoor adventurers and content creators alike will absolutely love.\n\n                  $519\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $519\n            at\n      DJI\n      \n Give someone's TV a major sound enhancement: Bose Smart Ultra soundbar \n\n\n            \n                Bose\n\n                          \nOne of the biggest problems with some big screen TVs -- whether they're 55 inches, 85 inches or anywhere in between -- is that their sound quality often leaves a lot to be desired. It's simply not up to par with a TV's impressive picture quality. The easiest remedy for this (and to create a more cinematic and immersive viewing experience within a home) is to connect a soundbar to the TV. \n\n\nThe new Bose Smart Ultra soundbar is the company's latest and most advanced model, designed to work seamlessly with virtually any TV. Utilizing artificial intelligence and Dolby Atmos technology, it can replicate surround sound without requiring a separate subwoofer and rear speakers, though these can be added for an authentic surround sound experience. This soundbar also offers a special dialogue mode, so if someone has trouble hearing the voices in a TV show or movie when there's music and sound effects also playing, this feature enhances the dialog in a way that makes it much clearer, so it's easier to hear and understand. The Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar connects to a TV via an HDMI or optical audio cable. While the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar might look like every other soundbar from the outside, this one has proprietary Bose technology on the inside that will immediately and dramatically enhance someone's TV viewing experience, regardless of what they're watching. \n\n                  $899\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $899\n            at\n      Walmart\n      \n\n\n\n For the person who's constantly losing things: Apple AirTags \n\n\n            \n                Walmart\n\n                          \nIf you know an Apple user who is constantly forgetting where they left their wallet, purse, TV remote, eyeglass case, keys or just about any other item, an Apple AirTag is the perfect stocking stuffer. These small Bluetooth trackers are 1.6-inches wide and 0.31-inches thick and can be inserted into a purse, backpack, eyeglass case, wallet, or luggage. There are also optional AirTag holders that make it easy to attach an AirTag with various other items. When an item that the AirTag is associated with gets misplaced, an iPhone can be used to track it if it's within close proximity. Or, the AirTag can send an alert to your iPhone if someone accidentally leaves an item with the AirTag behind.\u00a0 \n\n\nHowever, where this tracker really comes in handy is when it's placed in Lost Mode. When this happens, Apple is able to use the global network of iPhone users to help someone locate their missing item (and AirTag). This happens automatically, anonymously and in the background.\u00a0 When any other iPhone user comes into close proximity to the lost item (linked with the AirTag), the item owner's phone receives a message containing it's exact location. However, if someone discovers the lost item and taps their iPhone to the AirTag, the person who found the item can receive a message that displays the item owner's contact information, so it can be returned. AirTags are not GPS trackers. These small devices rely on Bluetooth. However, they work well if the missing item is still in close proximity or in areas that are heavily populated with other iPhone users (of which there are 1.46 billion+ of them around the world).\u00a0 \n\n                  $25 (1-Pack)\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $79 (4-Pack)\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n Give someone animated art or share a favorite video clip: Infinite Objects \n\n\n            \n                Infinite Objects\n\n                          \nDigital picture frames are nothing new, but what Infinite Objects offers is something truly unique. It's the ideal gift for someone who likes tech, but is difficult to shop for. Instead of displaying a series still digital images, these contemporary looking acrylic frames can either continuously display an animated piece of art that you pre-select, or a favorite video clip. This content gets permanently loaded into the frame, so there's no internet connection necessary. Simply turn on the frame and it displays the video clip or artwork that's been installed into it.\u00a0 The Infinite Object frames are definitely conversation starters. The person you give it to will never get bored looking at it. These frames make an excellent piece of decor for a desk, nightstand, bookcase, or when it's hung on a wall. Choose between a five-, seven-, or 10-inch frame in acrylic, or a five- or seven-inch frame in bamboo. When placing your order, you can upload your own video clip that's up to 30 minutes in length and at least 1,024 x 576 pixel resolution (in MP4 or MOV format).\u00a0 \n\n\nInstead of your own video, Infinite Objects offers hundreds of visually interesting animated artworks to choose from. Or, if the frame's recipient owns an NTF, that piece of digital art can be printed to the frame. Pricing starts at $79 and goes up to $450 for the larger size frame that displays a piece limited edition animated artwork. \n\n                  $79 and Up\n            at\n      Infinite Objects\n      \n  For the movie fan: Nanoleaf 4D screen mirror and light strip \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Nanoleaf\n\n                          \nThis smart lighting system, equipped with a camera, syncs with your TV to display immersive, dynamic colors. Over 50 LEDs create stunning visual effects across ten separate zones per meter, thanks to a tiny camera that optimizes real-time color selection. \n\n\nThe LEDs, which can accurately display more than 16 million colors, are integrated into a light strip that comes in two sizes -\u2013 one for TVs up to 65 inches, and the other for TVs up to 85 inches. Either light strip can be trimmed to fit perfectly behind the TV it's being used with. And when someone isn't watching TV, the lights are adjustable using the Nanoleaf mobile or desktop app, voice commands, or the included remote control.\u00a0 Choose from four screen mirror modes when watching TV, movies, sports or gaming to control light immersion. Sync with music for a fun audio-visual light show. With a 25,000+ hour lifetime, this gift promises years of enjoyment. Plus, you can expand it with Nanoleaf's other smart lighting systems for seamless synchronization. \n\n\nThere are many LED smart light strips on the market, but this one easily mounts to any TV, is made from quality components, and can create an immersive viewing experience that's visually stunning. The whole setup is also very easy to operate and offers a wide range of ways it can be used beyond when just watching TV. \n\n                  $120\n            at\n      Nanoleaf\n      \n For the techie who can't cook: Brava smart oven starter set\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Brava\n\n                          \nPreparing restaurant quality meals can be a hassle, especially if the person in charge doesn't know how to cook. That's where smart technology comes in. The Brava smart oven has all sorts of technology that helps makes preparing elaborate meals incredibly simple. This device is not your run-of-the-mill convection oven. It's actually 10 devices packed into one countertop unit. \n\n\nThe Brava smart oven can serve as a traditional convection oven, air fryer, toaster, slow cooker, reheater, dehydrator, rice cooker and more. It also roasts and bakes. And best of all, you don't need to know anything about cooking, baking or technology to prepare incredibly tasty meals using your own groceries. There's no meal subscription plan to sign up for. The \"smart\" aspect of this device has more than 7,000 customizable cooking programs that are quickly searchable and selectable using the mobile app. The oven is able to perfectly prepare three core ingredients (including a protein and vegetables) at the same time, with no need to flip or rotate food as it's cooking. The Brava smart oven revolutionizes cooking by preparing meals 2 to 4 times faster than traditional methods and ensuring perfect results with technology. Just choose a recipe, place raw, frozen, or pre-cooked ingredients on a tray, press a button, and let the oven handle the rest. It notifies you when your meal is ready via smartphone. This versatile oven can cook various dishes, making meal options limitless, and cleanup is a breeze. \n\n\nThe Brava smart oven is ideal for someone who lives alone or for a couple that needs to prepare enough food for a single meal, without generating waste or having to store leftovers. It's incredibly simple to use, and the types of meals, snacks and desserts this smart oven can prepare is practically limitless.\u00a0 \n\n                  $1,295\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n For the frequent traveler: Allocacoc Power Cube \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Walmart\n\n                          \nAnyone who travels a lot or works remotely from hotels, airports or coffeeshops knows that finding enough power outlets to keep a laptop computer and multiple mobile devices charged can be a huge challenge.\u00a0 \n\n\nThat's where the Power Cube comes in handy. This 2.25 by 2.52 inch cube contains four power outlets and two USB Type-A ports, a surge protector and a 10-foot cable that plugs into a single electrical outlet. This makes it compact enough to travel with, but versatile enough to provide multiple power outlets when and where they're needed. This truly is a \"must have\" tool for frequent travelers. And at just $35, it's more on the affordable side too.\u00a0 Why we choose it: Power Cube is easier to carry around than a traditional power strip and extension cord.\u00a0 \n\n                  $25\n            at\n      Walmart\n      \nThere's also a similar version of the\u00a0Power Cube\u00a0that's configured with five outlets and a 4.9-foot power cable (but no USB ports). \n\n                  $14\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For the coffee lover: Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDo you know someone who loves coffee and spends a fortune at Starbucks or their favorite coffee shop? Well, here's a smart coffee maker that allows someone to enjoy a really good cup of coffee that's custom made to their personal taste and specifications. The Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the ideal gift for lovers of the morning joe. It works with any of Keurig's K-Cups and has an integrated milk frother, allowing it to prepare coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, hot cocoa or tea. Users can also choose between preparing hot beverages or brewing them over ice. What makes this a \"smart\" coffee maker? Well, it runs using a mobile app and immediately identifies whatever K-Cup is inserted into it. The coffee maker then adjusts its internal settings accordingly to bring out the flavor of the K-Cup's contents. Using MultiStream technology, for each beverage, it's possible to select the strength of the brew, as the coffee maker saturates the coffee grounds to extract the full flavor and aroma. \n\n\nUsers can select their mug/cup size (between 2 or 4-ounce coffee shots, or a 6, 8, 10 or 12-ounce cup). This countertop coffee maker can prepare a wide range of specialty drinks and even keeps track of a home's K-Cup inventory. When a specific flavor or variety is running low, the machine will automatically order more K-Cups (at a discount), so nobody in the household ever runs out of their favorite flavor or blend. Perhaps the biggest perk of the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker is the time and money it saves compared to constantly going to your favorite cafes.\u00a0 From a technology standpoint, we found the Keurig K-Cafe smart single serve coffee maker to be easy to use. It offers a huge variety of hot and cold beverages options. It also gives users multiple options to customize their favorite drinks. \n\n                  $183\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For the avid reader and notetaker: reMarkable Paper Pro\n\n\n            \n                reMarkable\n\n                          \nThe first thing someone typically notices when removing the reMarkable Paper Pro from its packaging are just how lightweight and thin the device is. Yet, this digotal notepad provides an impressively large, 11.8 inch color digital ink display that's glare-free. The stylus connects to the e-reader using a magnet and quickly recharges while it's connected.\u00a0The Paper Pro's display is more responsive and smooth than what we've seen from competing full-color digital ink displays. It relies on E Ink Gallery 3 technology and is able to showcase more accurate colors than many other full-color e-readers, without causing eye strain that is common with many LED and LCD displays found in tablets and laptops. The handwriting experience is very similar in feel to writing on paper using a pen thanks to the screen's texture and the design of the stylus. Yet, you can change the color, style and thickness of the virtual link with a few on-screen taps.\n\n\nAs an e-reader, any e-books available in either the industry-standard ePub or PDF file formats work fine with this device. However, if you want to be able to customize the size of the text and choose the font an e-book is displayed in, choose e-books in the ePub file format. Any PDF documents viewed on the Paper Pro (as with any device) retain the format and appearance they were created with.Compared to other digital notepads that also serve as e-readers, this model has a more intuitive interface that runs using reMarkable's proprietary operating system. As an e-reader, the device lacks some of the functionality you'd get from an Amazon Kindle. It's not waterproof, nor is it designed to play audiobooks or podcasts. Much more emphasis has been put on note-taking and digital notepad functionality, as well as viewing and being able to annotate full-color PDF documents and files.\n\n\nWe're huge fans of the Paper Pro's design and overall performance, but instead of having an online e-book store of its own, you'll need to find and acquire your e-books from independent sources, such as\u00a0ebooks.com\u00a0or\u00a0BAM! Books-A-Million e-book store. As a note-taking tool and digital notepad, this is hands-down the best we've seen.\n\n                  $629 (with Marker Plus stylus)\n            at\n      Best Buy\n      \n\n\n                  $579 (with basic stylus)\n            at\n      reMarkable\n      \n For the aspiring writer: Freewrite Traveler \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIs there someone you know who dreams of becoming a book author? Well, if they have trouble staying focused when they sit down to write on their desktop or laptop computer, because they constantly get bombarded by alerts, alarms, notifications, incoming emails and the urge to check their social media account, then the Freewrite Traveler is the dedicated digital writing tool they need. \n\n\nThis is a portable digital typewriter and that's it. It allows someone to focus exclusively on their writing, with no digital distractions. In fact, the Freewrite Traveler does not even use a full-featured word processor, so there are no restrictions related to formatting text or worrying about spelling and grammar checkers (until the editing process). The purpose of this portable device is to allow someone to simply focus on their writing and allow their creativity to flow freely.\u00a0 As documents are created, they automatically sync with a cloud-based service (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Evernote), so they can be viewed, edited, printed or shared on a computer using any full featured word processor or text editor. Like popular e-readers, the Freewrite Traveler relies on an e-ink display that can be easily seen in bright light (including sunlight) or in a dark room. The screen does not cause eye fatigue and is virtually glare-free. The full-size keyboard uses responsive scissor switch keys, which makes typing smooth, more accurate and comfortable. And because the device is small (about half the size of a traditional laptop computer), lightweight (1.6 pounds) and its battery lasts up to four weeks, someone can get their writing done virtually anywhere.\u00a0 \n\n\nThe Freewrite Traveler is a great gift for accomplished or aspiring novelists, poets and authors who want a comfortable and distraction-free writing experience they can use whenever inspiration comes to them. Who knows, someone who receives this as a gift might be so grateful, they dedicate their next novel to you. \n\n                  $529\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n For nostalgic music lovers: Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive premium turntable\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nIn the past few years, record players and turntables that play vinyl records have had a resurgence in popularity, so if your husband has a record collection from his earlier years stored in the attic or basement, giving him a premium turntable will allow him to reconnect with the unique sound quality of records (compared to streaming audio).\u00a0\n\n\nFor someone who already has a sound system in place, the Marantz TT-15S1 manual belt-drive turntable offers a high-end way for your husband to enjoy his favorite vinyl albums in a way that captures the warmth of analog music. This turntable not only looks beautiful, it makes 33 \u2153 and 45 RPM sound fantastic. Using a floating motor, it deadens vibrations and distortions in a way that brings out an album's authentic stereo sound.\u00a0For more than 50 years, Marantz has manufactured high-end audio equipment. This turntable taps into those decades of expertise, yet uses modern technology and a contemporary design aesthetic to provide a nostalgic vinyl album listening experience your husband will truly appreciate.\n\n                  $1,799\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\n For carrying a laptop computer: Timbuk2 Custom messenger bag \n\n\n\n\n            \n                TimBuk2\n\n                          \nTimBuk2 is a San Francisco-based company that makes high-quality messenger bags, luggage and backpacks that are durable and come in a wide range of sizes and color combinations. However, instead of choosing a pre-made bag to give to someone as a gift (which you can certainly do), the Timbuk2 website has a bag design tool that allows anyone with a computer to custom-design their own messenger bag\u2013-which will then be created and sent to their home within days. To give a custom messenger bag to someone as a gift, get them a digital gift card from the TimBuk2 website for $150 (or more). The recipient will be able to redeem that gift card online and then choose the style, colors and accessories incorporated into their custom bag. For example, a padded laptop sleeve can be added to a messenger bag, along with a drink holder pocket and an upgraded padded shoulder strap.\u00a0 \n\n\nNot only are the TikBuk2 bags functional and versatile, they're also well made and designed to last for years. Even the smaller size messenger bags can hold a laptop computer in a padded compartment, while keeping other belongings well organized and easily accessible. Plus, someone can have as much fun designing their own bag as they will using it during their day-to-day adventures. \n\n                  $100 and up\n            at\n      Timbuk2\n      \n For showcasing digital photos: Skylight frame\n\n\n\n\n            \n                Amazon\n\n                          \nDo you know someone who is not at all tech savvy and who isn't active on social media, like your mother-in-law or grandmother?

Once it's connected to a home's Wi-Fi, anyone who is invited to can email the frame photos or video clips, from anywhere in the world, using their smartphone, tablet or computer. The frame actually comes with its own unique email address which makes sending content to it as easy as sending an email. Once delivered, the frame starts displaying the images within a minute or two and then adds the new images to its constantly playing digital slideshow. \n\n\nThe Skylight frame offers a 10-inch, high-resolution (1,2080 x 800 pixel) touchscreen display and has enough internal storage to hold more than 8,000 images. The frame surrounding the screen comes in black, silver, white or gold. From the settings menu, the frame can be set to an always on mode, or follow a predetermined schedule to automatically turn itself on and off. One handy feature is the frame's \"gift mode.\" It allows for someone to remotely pre-configure the frame and deliver initial photos to it, so all the recipient needs to do is take it out of the box and plug it in. Then, as photos or video clips are displayed, someone can swipe forwards or backwards to scroll through the stored images. Otherwise, they'll be displayed as part of an animated slideshow at the speed the user selects. One other great thing about this digital frame is that there's no ongoing subscription associated with it. Please note that the area where the frame is placed must have a continuous Internet connection via Wi-Fi to be able to receive images. \n\n\nThe Skylight frame can be pre-configured remotely. Invited friends and family can then email photos directly to the frame. \n\n                  $140\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n                  $130\n            at\n      Skylight\n      \n For the wellness fan: The Oura ring \n\n\n\n\n            \n                Oura\n\n                          \nMany smartphones and smartwatches come equipped with sensors to monitor various aspects of health, such as sleep patterns, stress levels and daily activity. However, these devices can be bulky and not always convenient to carry. Enter the Oura ring, a stylish 24/7 health tracker worn on your finger. It can monitor sleep, workouts, menstrual cycles, and more, with a battery life of up to a week and easy recharging using the provided charger. \n\n\nOnce users select their ring size and design on the Oura website, they receive their ring, which can be set up in minutes through the Oura mobile app. This ring keeps tabs on heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen (SpO2) levels, activity, stress, and sleep patterns. It securely and wirelessly transfers this data to the user's smartphone for analysis and storage. The Oura app, available on iOS, Android, and Apple Watch, provides insights into health, fitness, and sleep patterns, allowing users to track their progress and check various results based on their chosen metrics.\u00a0 Users can share data with Apple Health, Google Fit, and various other health and fitness apps for comprehensive analysis and insights. We love the Oura ring not only for its style and color options but also for its user-friendliness and comfort, weighing less than most traditional jewelry. To fully utilize the Oura ring, users will need an ongoing $5.99 per month subscription.The Oura ring can comfortably be worn 24/7, including in the shower, bathtub, or while swimming. It's available in two styles and a variety of colors. This is a great gift for someone who has trouble sleeping or who wants (or needs) to keep better tabs on their health and activity level. It's much more convenient to use than similar functionality that's offered by a smartwatch or activity tracker, because it can unobtrusively be worn all day and night on a finger.\n\n\nIf the person you're shopping for is a Samsung Galaxy smartphone user (or Android phone user for that matter), we recommend checking out the\u00a0Galaxy Ring\u00a0($400). It too offers a comprehensive collection of health, fitness tracking, sleep management and stress monitoring tools.\n\n                  $299 and up\n            at\n      Oura\n      \n For the adventurer: GoPro Hero 13 Black action camera \n\n\n\n\n            \n                GoPro\n\n                          \nWith all of the new advancements in the GoPro Hero 13 Black compact camera, referring to it as just an action camera is a misnomer. Yes, the GoPro Hero 13 Black is small, lightweight, waterproof, temperature-proof and durable -- all of the key features someone could want from an action camera. There are also dozens of mounts, mods and accessories that allow you to attach the camera to your body or equipment so you can capture content from a stunning, first-person perspective.\n\n\nHowever, this GoPro camera is an easy-to-use, point-and-shoot still image and broadcast-quality video camera, too, so it can also be used as an everyday point-and-shoot camera, vacation camera, vlogging camera and more, even if you're a total amateur. It also works as a webcam or live streaming camera.The GoPro Hero 13 Pro can capture still images at 27MP resolution. It can also capture video at up to 5.3K (60fps) resolution using a variety of shooting modes, lenses and field-of-view options. The image stabilization built into the camera is better than ever, as is its low-light and nighttime shooting capabilities. There's even a new 400fps slow-motion feature.\n\n\nThe most exciting additions to this year's model are the interchangeable, HB-Series lenses. To keep things super-simple, regardless of which lens you attach, it automatically identifies the lens and adjusts the camera's settings.\u00a0Available lenses include a macro lens mod, ultra wide lens mod, and a Smart Motion Blur ND filter 4-pack. Plus, an anamorphic lens mod will be released in early-2025. It will allow you to capture undistorted, 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio with lens flares when shooting video.\n\n\nOther notable enhancements include extended battery life for GoPro's Enduro interchangeable and rechargeable batteries. There's also a new magnetic door and power cable kit that makes it easier to keep the camera going using an external power source. Plus, GoPro has made some tweaks to the camera's mounting system. It now offers an optional magnetic mount add-on that makes it easy to attach and detach the camera from various stands, tripods and mounts in mere seconds, without having to tinker with a thumbscrew.Everything people love about the GoPro cameras continues to be offered by the GoPro Hero 13 Black, including the re-introduction of a GPS feature that tracks the time, date, location, speed and altitude of what you shoot. You can now use more voice commands to control the camera and pair it with Apple AirPods, any Bluetooth earbuds, or wireless microphones to capture narration or specialized audio. The new voice mode automatically prioritizes voice audio when recording video and eliminates unwanted ambient sounds. This is particularly useful to vloggers and live streamers.\n\n\nAnd best of all, when the camera is set on easy mode, it becomes an idiot-proof point-and-shoot camera that's ready for anything. So just about anyone can capture great content without having to tinker with complex settings. Pros can switch to advance mode and get manual control over the camera's many settings and features.The GoPro Hero 13 Black camera comes with one Enduro battery, USB cable, a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle and a thumb screw.

Even better, it can go from a laptop stand for use when sitting at a table or desk, to a stand that can be used from that flat surface while standing up. The Moft-Z unfolds and is ready to use in less than 15 seconds. It's available in four colors and has a weight capacity of 22 pounds. This is more than enough to safely hold any laptop computer. The design of the Moft-Z is brilliantly simple to use, yet complex in its design. It makes remote working much more comfortable. \n\n\nMeanwhile, if the person you're shopping for doesn't need the stand-up option built into the stand, the Moft Invisible Slip Laptop Stand ($24.99) uses adhesive to attach to the bottom of any laptop computer and then quickly unfolds to position the computer at the ideal typing and viewing angle -- either 15- or 25-degrees. This unit weighs just three ounces. The material uses is a mere 2.82mm thick. This version of the stand accommodates laptop computers up to 16-inches wide and that weigh up to 11 pounds. This is a wonderful and unique gift for someone who works remotely using a laptop computer It provides a more comfortable (and ergonomic) typing and viewing position. Either the Moft-Z or Moft Invisible Slip Laptop Stand fold up and are easy to transport. Both products can be set up on any flat surface in seconds. \n\n                  $60\n            at\n      Amazon\n      \n\n\n\nFor the frequent video caller: Lumecube Edge Light 2.0 Base Edition\n\n\n            \n                LumeCube\n\n                          \nTaking the traditional desk lamp to the next level, the Lumecube Edge Light 2.0 Base Edition is a contemporary looking light fixture that is fully adjustable. It's possible to adjust the light's arm to change its height, move around the circular LED light to a specific angle, and adjust the brightness and color temperature of the light itself. Light temperature can be adjusted between 2700K ad 7500K, while brightness can be adjusted from zero up to 700 lumens. Light emanates from a circular LED with a six-inch diameter. The weighted base keeps it firmly in place. \n\n\nPerhaps the best use of this desk lamp, thanks to its adjustability, is as a replacement for a ring light when participating in a video call or virtual meeting. When positioned toward someone's face while they're sitting at a desk, the Edge Light provides even lighting. We love the overall design and versatility of the Lumecube Edge Light 2.0 Base Edition because it offers so many adjustment options.

What they'll hear is consistently crystal clear, rich and robust audio. \n\n\nThese headphones offer Carbon Cone drive units that are specifically designed to reduce distortion and improve clarity.
