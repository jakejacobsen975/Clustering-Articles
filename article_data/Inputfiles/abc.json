In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads. Data from recent years has showed that Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef control more than 80% of the U.S. beef market combined, the suit notes.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chief-operating-officer-truth-socials-parent-company-resigns-114495220", "Title": "Chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company resigns", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 4, 2024, 8:24 AM", "content": "The chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company has resigned and the company must hand over almost 800,000 shares to one of its investors as part of a court ruling, according to a regulatory filing.COO Andrew Northwall resigned from Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. late last month, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, adding that the company plans to \u201ctransition his duties internally.\u201d No further details were provided about the resignation.

The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/imminent-dockworkers-strike-raise-holiday-prices-experts/story?id=114346872", "Title": "Dockworkers hit picket lines in historic US port strike that could impact prices", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 2, 2024, 6:11 PM", "content": "Tens of thousands of U.S. dockworkers walked off the job early Tuesday morning, clogging dozens of ports along the East and Gulf coasts and potentially raising consumer prices ahead of the holiday season.The ports account for more than half of the nation's container imports, facilitating the transport of everything from toys to fresh fruit to nuclear reactors, JPMorgan senior equity analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a report shared with ABC News.\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday emphasizing the strong profits enjoyed by shipping firms in recent years, as well as the sacrifices made by dockworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden called for a fair offer from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, an organization bargaining on behalf of the dockworkers' employers.\n\"It is time for USMX to negotiate a fair contract with the longshoremen that reflects the substantial contribution they've been making to our economic comeback,\" Biden said in the statement.\nThe International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) confirmed to ABC News early Tuesday that the union's first coastwide strike in nearly 50 years was underway. The statement said that \"tens of thousands of ILA rank-and-file members\" started to set up picket lines at shipping ports up and down the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as of 12:01 a.m.\n\"We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,\" ILA President Harold Daggett said.\nUSMX said Wednesday it was focused on ratifying a new contract \"that addresses all the critical issues the parties need to bargain.\"\n\"Reaching an agreement will require negotiating -- and our full focus is on how to return to the table to further discuss these vital components, many of which are intertwined,\" it said in a statement. \"We cannot agree to preconditions to return to bargaining -- but we remain committed to bargaining in good faith to address the ILA's demands and USMX's concerns.\nA top Biden administration official said late Tuesday that the U.S. Maritime Alliance needed to put forward a fair offer to union dockworkers.\n\"The parties need to get back to the negotiating table, and that must begin with these giant shipping magnates acknowledging that if they can make record profits, their workers should share in that economic success,\" Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said.\nSu said she spent \"hours on the phone and in meetings\" with both parties over the last week, urging them to find a way to reach a fair contract.\nA prolonged work stoppage of several weeks or months could rekindle inflation for some goods and trigger layoffs at manufacturers as raw materials dry up, experts said.\n\"A strike would be very, very disruptive,\" said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University who closely tracks imports, told ABC News.\n\"You can't take all this freight and either send it to other ports or put it on airplanes,\" Miller added. \"There is no plan B.\"\nThe ILA, the union representing East Coast and Gulf Coast dockworkers, is seeking higher wages and a ban on the use of some automated equipment.\n\"ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,\" the ILA told ABC News in a statement on Monday. \"Meanwhile, ILA dedicated longshore workers continue to be crippled by inflation due to USMX's unfair wage packages.\"\nBiden retains the power to prevent or halt a strike under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Biden on Monday urging the White House to intervene, which it has previously said it will not do. The White House told ABC News in a statement that it has been in contact with both the union and management in recent days.\n\"This weekend, senior officials have been in touch with USMX representatives urging them to come to a fair agreement fairly and quickly \u2013 one that reflects the success of the companies. Senior officials have also been in touch with the ILA to deliver the same message,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.\nA prolonged East Coast and Gulf Coast port strike could moderately increase prices for a range of goods, experts told ABC News. That upward pressure on prices would result from a shortage of products caught up in the supply chain blockage, leaving too many dollars chasing after too few items, they added.\nFood products are especially vulnerable to an uptick in prices, since food could spoil if suppliers sent the products ahead of time to minimize the strike impact, as they have done for some other goods, Adam Kamins, a senior director of economic research at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News.\nAdditionally, a significant share of the nation's imported auto parts pass through the ports impacted by a potential strike, which could cause an increase in vehicle prices if the strike persists.\nPrice increases have slowed dramatically from a peak in 2022, but inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. A strike could prevent further progress, according to Kamins.\n\"We're not talking about prices skyrocketing by any means, but I think it halts the momentum we've had over the last year or so getting inflation back in the bottle,\" he said.\nIn 2002, a strike among workers at West Coast ports lasted 11 days before then-President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and ended the standoff. However, the last time East Coast and Gulf Coast workers went on strike, in 1977, the work stoppage lasted seven weeks.\nTuesday's potential work stoppage follows high-profile strikes undertaken last year by auto workers as well as Hollywood writers and actors. Most recently, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job in early September, demanding better pay and retirement benefits.\n\"Trade unions all over the country have been going out on strike,\" Sriram Narayanan, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News. \"We're seeing that happen now at the ports.\"\nAhead of the historic strike, the president of the Teamsters labor union, Sean O'Brien, released a letter of solidarity to the International Longshoreman's Association, saying, \"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, including our members in the freight industry, stand in full solidarity with the International Longshoremen's Association as they fight for a fair and just contract with the ocean carriers represented by USMX.\"\n\"Don't forget --Teamsters do not cross picket lines. The Teamsters Union is 100 percent committed to standing with our Longshoremen brothers and sisters until they win the contract they deserve,\" O'Brien said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/musks-reinstated-brazil-after-complying-supreme-court-demands-114618439", "Title": "Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 PM", "content": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\nX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hunt-gasoline-adding-floridians-anxiety-milton-nears-114609527", "Title": "The hunt for gasoline is adding to Floridians\u2019 anxiety as Milton nears", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:02 PM", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida gas stations struggled to keep up with demand Tuesday as long lines and empty pumps compounded the stress for residents planning to hunker down or flee as Hurricane Milton approached the state's western coast.

They have very different plans for doing it.", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 2, 2024, 2:34 PM", "content": "In the final weeks of the campaign, former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have sought to best each other on the all-important issue of the economy, which many voters rank as their top concern.Both candidates have made manufacturing a centerpiece of their plans, but their respective approaches feature stark differences.\nHarris aims to close corporate tax loopholes and throw government support behind the production of critical goods. By contrast, Trump wants to protect domestic manufacturers with tariffs on foreign products while cutting corporate taxes and easing regulations.\nManufacturing accounts for about 10% of U.S. gross domestic product and an even smaller share of the nation's jobs. But the sector bears outsized importance since the production of essential goods holds national security implications and many manufacturing workers live in key swing states, experts said.\n\"There's a belief that manufacturing is special,\" Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who studies trade policy, told ABC News.\nHere's what to know about where Harris and Trump stand on manufacturing, and what experts think of their respective plans:\nOn the campaign trail, Trump talks about tariffs more than just about any other policy proposal. The tax on imports makes up a key part of his plan for revitalizing manufacturing, alongside a lower tax burden for companies that he says would boost production and hiring.\nTrump has promised a sharp escalation of tariffs enacted during his first term. Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods. A set of far-reaching tariffs would also include a tax as high as 20% on all imported products.\nIn theory, a tax on imports would give domestic producers a leg up in competition with foreign manufacturers, Christopher Conlon, a professor of economics at New York University who studies trade, told ABC News.\n\"His plan is based on the idea that foreign competitors are pricing their products too low and what we need to do is erect a wall of tariff barriers around the U.S.,\" Conlon told ABC News.\nAn escalation of tariffs could expand certain areas of U.S. manufacturing vulnerable to foreign competition, which could result in added jobs at companies protected by the policy, experts said.\nThe economy added manufacturing over the first few years of his presidency, though the pandemic wiped out much of those gains.\nExperts cautioned about a spike in input costs and consumer prices that could end up hindering many manufacturers and hammering household budgets. Evidence indicates that the Trump tax cut did not provide a significant boost for the economy, they added.\nU.S. manufacturers of sophisticated products like automobiles and advanced medical equipment often import raw materials. A tariff would likely raise costs for those companies and risk making them less competitive on the global market, Conlon said. While adding jobs at some manufacturers, the policy could cause layoffs at others.\n\"Nobody seems to have shared that wisdom with the Trump campaign,\" Conlon said.\nA similar cause and effect applies to prices paid by everyday people for imported goods at the grocery or department store. Broad tariffs on foreign goods would likely force importing companies to raise prices and reignite inflation, experts said.\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign said its manufacturing plan would create jobs and cut taxes.\n\"President Trump is a businessman who built the greatest economy in American history, and certainly doesn't need economics lessons from a professor who has never created jobs or built anything in his life,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\"President Trump successfully imposed tariffs on China in his first term AND cut taxes for hardworking Americans here at home -- and he will do it again in his second term. President Trump's plan will result in millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars returning home from China to America,\" the statement added in part.\nHarris has proposed a different approach to manufacturing that emphasizes closing tax loopholes for some large corporations and providing government support for high-priority areas within the sector.\nThe agenda carries over a key part of the strategy undertaken by the Biden administration, which invested billions into manufacturing through a series of measures focused on bolstering key industries.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost U.S. production of renewables as the nation pursues ambitious carbon emissions goals and a supply chain less dependent on China. While the CHIPS and Sciences Act infused tens of billions into the production of semiconductors.\n\"The Biden administration has picked sectors, and in those sectors companies are eligible for assistance,\" said Lovely.\nLast week, Harris put forward a plan calling for $100 billion investment in manufacturing to further bolster the sector. The policy would prioritize \"industries of the future,\" such as carbon-efficient steel production and data centers for artificial intelligence, the campaign said in a statement last week.\nThe Harris campaign said it aims to pay for the investment with a reform of the international tax code that prevents producers from skirting U.S. taxes in a \"race to the bottom.\"\n\"The facts are clear: When he was president, Trump lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs and created new incentives for companies to ship American jobs to China. Economists warn if Trump takes power again, his policies will crush American manufacturing jobs, send even more jobs to China, and cost middle class families $4,000 a year. This is a fundamental contrast with Vice President Harris, who is leading an American manufacturing boom \u2013 creating jobs right here at home and outcompeting China,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement to ABC News.\nIt remains unclear whether the support for manufacturing provided by the Biden administration has yielded significant gains in output or jobs, experts said.\nThe measures, however, have elicited a burst of factory construction. Spending on manufacturing-related construction surged from $76.4 billion in January 2021 to $238.2 billion in August 2024, U.S. Census Bureau data showed.\nThe surge in construction marks a positive signal but the critical test will be whether the plants deliver strong output and well-paying, long-term jobs, said Conlon.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-asian-shares-climb-after-blockbuster-114552440", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street slides after Treasury yields climb back above 4% and oil rises", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 12:43 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks slid Monday after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/coca-cola-spiced-canceled-after-7-months-market-114077311", "Title": "Coca-Cola Spiced is getting canceled after 7 months on the market", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "September 25, 2024, 10:55 AM", "content": "Coca-Cola Co. is discontinuing its newest \u201cpermanent\u201d flavor a little more than seven months after putting it on the market.The beverage giant said Wednesday that Coca-Cola Spiced and Coca-Cola Spiced Zero Sugar will be phased out and replaced with a new flavor that will be introduced next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at what our consumers like and adjusting our range of products,\u201d the Atlanta-based company said in a statement.\nCoca-Cola Spiced went on sale in the U.S. and Canada on Feb. 19.

In April, he proposed a higher tariff of at least 60% on Chinese goods.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News confirmed that tariffs are widely thought to raise prices for consumers in the importing country. That\u2019s because foreign producers typically pass along some or all of the tax burden to consumers in the form of higher prices, they said.\n\u201cThis is generally accepted in economics,\u201d said Stephan Weiler, a professor of economics at Colorado State University and a former Fed research officer.\nEconomists couldn't verify the estimate put forward by Harris of a 20% increase on the prices of goods, in part because it's difficult to predict exactly how foreign manufacturers might respond to tariffs.\nIn theory, foreign producers that control a given market could offset higher taxes by pushing the costs onto consumers with price increases, Yeva Nersisyan, a professor of economics at Franklin & Marshall College, told ABC News. However, Nersisyan added, companies in competitive industries may face more difficulty doing so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether that 20% number is accurate,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News rejected the assertion that the nation\u2019s bout of inflation marks its worst ever, noting that the U.S. endured higher price increases as recently as the 1980s.\nIn addition, economists said Trump overstated the extent to which the Biden administration caused the rapid rise in prices, though they acknowledged that a stimulus measure enacted by Biden may have contributed to some of the inflation.\nLike many economic problems, inflation emerged due to an imbalance between supply and demand, economists said.\nHundreds of millions of people across the globe who endured pandemic-era lockdowns replaced restaurant expenditures with online orders of couches and exercise bikes. But the demand for goods and labor far outpaced supply, as COVID-19-related bottlenecks slowed delivery times and infection fears kept production workers on the sidelines.\n\u201cThe number-one cause of the inflation was a supply adjustment to the COVID shock, particularly coming out of isolation,\u201d Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, told ABC News.\nPandemic-era spending measures enacted by Trump and Biden may also have contributed to the price spike, economists said.\nJason Furman, a professor at Harvard University and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, estimated that Biden's American Rescue Plan added between 1 and 4 percentage points to the inflation rate in 2021, Roll Call reported. Michael Strain, of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the legislation added 3 percentage points to inflation.\n\u201cOne could argue that the COVID-related policies helped heat and possibly overheat the economy,\u201d Weiler said.\nThe economy had already emerged from the pandemic-induced recession and begun to recover by the time Biden took office, economists said.\nHowever, the U.S. remained well below pre-pandemic levels in some key measures of economic health, including employment. In turn, economists said, Biden inherited an economy in need of significant rejuvenation.\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020 when Trump was in office \u2013 which was indeed the highest level since the Great Depression, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But unemployment rapidly declined to 6.4% in January 2021 by the time Trump left office, as the economy started to rebalance.\nThe effort to blame Trump for the spike in unemployment is misleading, since it resulted from a once-in-a-century pandemic, economists said.\n\u201cCOVID is the tidal wave that overwhelmed the whole story,\u201d Weiler said. \u201cThe politics of this is hyperbole.\u201d\nThe COVID-induced recession lasted two months in the spring of 2020, the shortest U.S. recession ever recorded, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-profit organization that serves as the recognized authority on economic downturns. The speedy recovery was owed in part to trillions in economic stimulus enacted by Trump that March.\n\u201cIt was very quick and very, very big,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nStill, the economy suffered a dearth of jobs and persistent supply blockages when Biden took office, economists said. Over the course of the Biden administration, the labor market expanded at a rapid pace while economic growth quickened. By 2022, the economy had recovered all of the jobs that were lost during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe recovery from the recession had already begun when Biden took office, but it hadn\u2019t gotten that far,\u201d Frankel said.\nTrump sharply criticized Harris for a perceived lack of detailed economic proposals.\nSome economists who spoke to ABC News agreed that there was an absence of a complete economic plans from Harris. However, they added, Trump has also failed to provide a detailed set of policy proposals on economic issues.\n\u201cI would like to see more detailed policy proposals from both candidates,\u201d Anne Villamil, a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, told ABC News.\n\u201cFor Harris, I would like to know how her policies would differ from current policies,\u201d Villamil added. \u201cFor Trump, I would like to know how his policies would differ from the policies of his previous administration.\u201d\nLast month, Harris unveiled economic plans intended to ease inflation, fix the housing market, and slash taxes for middle-income families. The plans include eye-catching proposals such as a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers and a ban on grocery price gouging, the latter of which had not been put forward by Biden.\nHarris has also proposed a 28% tax on long-term capital gains, which clocks in well below the 39.6% tax rate for such income put forward by Biden.\nTrump has said he would renew his signature tax-cut measure, which eased taxes for individuals and corporations, while vowing to do away with taxes on tips and Social Security benefits.\n\u201cTrump is not one who has a lot of detailed policies himself,\u201d Nersisyan said. \u201cThis is not a policy election.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/austrian-activist-schrems-wins-privacy-case-meta-personal-114492941", "Title": "Activist wins privacy case against Meta over personal data on sexual orientation", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 4, 2024, 7:13 AM", "content": "LONDON -- The European Union's top court said Friday that social media company Meta can't use public information about a user's sexual orientation obtained outside its platforms for personalized advertising under the bloc's strict data privacy rules.

But Black and Latina women are starting to gain ground, landing top positions at some of the biggest unions in the U.S. That has translated into wins at the bargaining table that focus more attention on family-friendly benefits like parental leave and health care coverage, as well as protections against sexual harassment. \nOften when people think about unions, \"they think of a white guy in a hard hat. But in fact, studies show that about two-thirds of working people who are covered by a union contract are women and/or people of color,\u201d said Georgetown University labor historian Lane Windham.\nIndeed, hospitality union UNITE HERE's membership is majority women and people of color. And last month, more than 12,000 of them across six states went on strike to push for wage increases, fair workloads and more affordable health care under the leadership of Gwen Mills, who in June became the first woman to be elected union president in its 130-year history. \nData from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that Black and Latina women experience a particularly wide gender pay gap. They also face intersectional headwinds of both racism and sexism in their careers, making them even more attuned to inequities in the workplace and motivating them to increasingly step up the fight as union leaders. \nBlack and Latina women are driving labor union growth in the U.S. amid a decades-long decline in membership. In 2023, Black women's union membership rate notched a slight bump from 10.3% to 10.5%, while Latinas went up from 8.5% to 8.8%. But that's still more than white men and women as well as Asian women, whose membership experienced a decrease during the same time period. \nMomentum for Black and Latina women rising into labor union leadership has picked up in the last five years. But the work began long before that by \"our foremothers who laid this foundation and have been pushing and kicking those doors open for decades,\u201d according to Liz Shuler, who in June 2022 became the first woman in history to lead the AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 national and international labor unions. \n\u201cThe #MeToo movement, I think, has really emboldened women across the board, including in labor, to say, you know what? I\u2019m not going to be sitting on the sidelines,\u201d Shuler said. The pandemic also put a spotlight on essential workers such as nurses, service workers and care workers, who are predominantly women and minorities.\nToday\u2019s examples of diverse union leaders include Becky Pringle, a Black woman who leads the National Education Association, the nation's largest union; Bonnie Castillo, the first Latina to serve as executive director of National Nurses United; and April Verrett, who in May became the first Black woman to lead the Service Employees International Union, which says about 60% of its service worker members are people of color, and two-thirds are women. \n\u201cIf we want to build power on those who are perceived to have the least amount of power, then we've got to create space for our people of those identities to be able to lead,\u201d Verrett told The Associated Press.\nBut while female-dominated fields have made strides in union leadership diversity, \u201cthere is still a long way to go\u201d for unions in male-dominated fields like building and manufacturing trades, said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign labor historian Emily Twarog. Despite some headway through DEI and apprenticeship programs, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been that kind of culture shift.\u201d\nMen still have a higher union membership rate than women \u2014 10.5% versus 9.5% respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And workplace sexual harassment and biases still run rampant in many places, including for Chicago-based Lisa Lujano, a journey-level carpenter and member of Carpenters Union Local 13. \nThings might get better, she said, if more Black and Latina women held union leadership roles and were more aware of their memberships' needs, including safety gear that fits women\u2019s bodies, or parental leave, which Lujano does not have. \n\u201cI think we would get more respect out in the field,\u201d she said.\nHere's a look at the impact women union leaders have had at the bargaining table:\nTeachers\u2019 unions have in recent years begun to use their collective power to push for wraparound benefits to help their surrounding community in a method known as \"bargaining for the common good,\" which aims to go beyond wages and benefits at the bargaining table and tackle wider social issues. The Chicago Teachers Union, for example, included demands for affordable housing citywide during a strike in 2019 \u2014 in part organized by then-vice president Stacy Davis Gates, who is now CTU president.\nSome teachers' unions are also fighting for racial justice, including the United Teachers Los Angeles, which demanded that the school district stop subjugating students to random metal detector screenings and locker checks without cause, decrying the practice as disproportionately targeting Black and minority students.\n\u201cWe need to address the inequities that are built into every single social system in this country that determine whether our students come to school ready to learn every day,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cIt was our female leaders, particularly our leaders of color, who really leaned into that.\u201d\nUnionized hotel workers like Maria Mata have made strides toward fighting the rampant sexual harassment in their profession.\nMata, a Hispanic housekeeper and UNITE HERE union leader at the W San Francisco, helped lead a successful push at her hotel for workers to be equipped with panic buttons in 2018 to summon security help in an emergency, now implemented by several major hotel chains.\n\u201cWe needed more protection,\u201d especially during night shifts spent cleaning entire floors alone, explained Mata, who has herself twice experienced sexual harassment on the job. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous.\" \nIt\u2019s also vital for the women doing the work to also sit at the bargaining table, \u201cbecause sometimes as women, we need something that the men don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mata, whose hotel is currently in bargaining for a new contract.\nKeturah Johnson in 2022 became the first queer woman of color to serve as international vice president for flight attendant union AFA-CWA, which is led by Sara Nelson and represents over 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.\nPeople often think of a flight attendant as \u201ca white woman with hair put up in a bun,\u201d and Black flight attendants frequently face microaggressions from managers about their appearance, Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened to me many times because of my natural hair.\"\nAnd for gender nonconforming flight attendants, being able to wear a uniform that reflects their gender identity is important, Johnson said. So she's leading the fight to update uniform standards to be gender inclusive and permit natural hairstyles, which has resulted in several airlines making changes.\nUnited Airlines, for instance, updated its uniform standards to include gender neutral options in 2021, and Alaska Airlines management adopted gender neutral uniform and appearance standards in 2022, according to AFA. Frontier allowed natural hairstyles for flight attendants in 2021, and this year implemented standardized pricing for all uniforms regardless of size or gender.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just there to serve Diet Coke. And so it\u2019s our job to make sure that flight attendants are represented and seen just as they are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe world is changed now.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/airlines-capping-fares-hurricanes-path-biden-warns-price-114622015", "Title": "Airlines say they're capping fares in the hurricane's path as Biden warns against price gouging", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 5:44 PM", "content": "A few airports in Florida began closing and airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Tuesday ahead of Hurricane Milton's arrival.

It went up to like $750 within a matter of seconds,\u201d she said. \"There were prices even as high as $1,000 for one leg. So wrong! So wrong!\u201d \nJeremy Bingaman, a music-industry podcaster, posted a screenshot of United Airlines fares for flights out of Tampa to St. Louis on Tuesday. They went as high as $2,351 for refundable tickets in economy class on United Express, compared with Southwest, which showed tickets at $399, and American, which displayed flights to Chicago for around $600.\n\u201cHey (at)united, what\u2019s up with the price gouging in Tampa for people trying to evacuate? ... shady,\u201d he wrote in an X post that was reposted more than 4,000 times.\nNone of those flights he highlighted took off \u2014 they were all scheduled after the airport suspended operations. \nUnited spokesperson Leslie Scott said the itinerary that Bingaman posted included two connections, and noted that the flight never happened.\n\u201cWe implemented fare caps on Sunday. Since then, the average price paid for a one-way, economy-class ticket to our hubs from the impacted Florida markets was below $500,\u201d Scott said.\nDelta said it capped fares, although it gave no figures.

The safety of our passengers and employees is our top priority.\u201d\nEven when the weather is good, airlines often raise prices on tickets bought hours or a few days before departure, when there are fewer unsold seats left. That can blur the line between price gouging and the airlines' regular practice of maximizing revenue from each flight.\nBiden did not give any examples of price gouging this week. A spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Department said the agency has been in touch with airlines to get more information about the availability and affordability of flights in the storm's path.\nEarlier, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a post on X, \u201cThe Department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously. We are keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton to make sure airlines are not charging excessively increasing fares.\u201d\nWilliam McGee, a travel expert and advocate for the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes big corporations, said his group has seen the comments on social media about airlines \u2014 especially United, Delta and American \u2014 raising prices as the hurricane approached Florida. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with growing frequency in the deregulated era in response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks,\u201d McGee said. \"It\u2019s important for consumers who are experiencing this to file complaints with the (Transportation Department) and perhaps share details on social media.\u201d\nU.S. flight cancellations were expected to soar past 1,600 on Wednesday, when Milton was forecast to come ashore along Florida's central Gulf coast. The bulk of those cancellations are in Florida. \nSt. Pete-Clearwater International Airport said it would close after the last flight Tuesday and reopen on Friday. Orlando International Airport planned to shut down Wednesday morning, and nearby Melbourne Orlando International Airport said it would stop flights Wednesday afternoon until Friday.\nTravelers struggling to get out of Florida expressed exasperation and fatigue over high prices, canceled and delayed flights, and poor customer service.\nJohn Fedor, a roofer from the Philadelphia suburbs, and his wife were trying to get home after a Caribbean cruise. They missed their flight out of Tampa. He said they got no help and were \u201ctreated so horribly\u201d by a Frontier Airlines agent, then looked into other ways home. He was quoted $675 for a rental car. They saw train fares for $125 each, but by the time they tried to purchase a pair, the train was sold out.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get home. We don\u2019t know what day we\u2019re getting home,\u201d Fedor said. \u201cThis probably has been the worst vacation of my life.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/piece-piece-pharrell-finds-lego-fits-life-story-114619802", "Title": "In 'Piece by Piece,' Pharrell finds Lego fits his life story", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:58 PM", "content": "TORONTO -- When Pharrell Williams and Morgan Neville decided to embark on a movie about Williams\u2019 life but animated in Lego pieces, they knew there would be culture shocks. But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/marshall-retiring-ceo-mavericks-end-2024-remain-consultant-114621140", "Title": "Marshall is retiring as the CEO of the Mavericks at the end of 2024 but will remain as a consultant", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:47 PM", "content": "DALLAS -- Cynt Marshall is retiring as CEO of the Dallas Mavericks at the end of the year, and then she will stay on for another year as a consultant in the organization where she is credited for a comprehensive overhaul of workplace policies.Marshall, a former AT&T executive, was introduced by the Mavericks in February 2018, about a week after a Sports Illustrated report detailed years of incidents of sexual harassment and misconduct in the franchise\u2019s business office.\nWhen hired, Marshall became the first Black female CEO in NBA history.

Jim Justice.One would reduce the state personal income tax by 2%. Another would provide a tax credit to help families pay for child care. The Republican governor is expected to sign both proposals, after they passed final legislative hurdles Tuesday during a special legislative session called by Justice. \nCuts to the state personal income tax have been a priority for Justice, who is nearing the end of his second term as governor and running for the U.S. Senate. He signed a 21.25% tax cut into effect last year, and the tax is scheduled to drop by another 4% in the new year, per a trigger in the 2023 law that allows for further tax cuts if the state meets higher-than-anticipated revenue collections.\nJustice had initially been pushing the Legislature to consider cutting the tax a further 5% but amended that proposal to a more conservative 2% cut Monday. \nA 2% cut in personal income tax rates would take effect on the first day of the new year and return approximately $46 million to taxpayers. Del. Vernon Criss, the House Finance Committee chair, said he would have preferred a 5% tax cut, but an agreement couldn't be made with the Senate to support that. \n\"I still think we are moving in the right direction,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what we all want.\"\nThe money to pay for the tax cut is coming from an expiring revenue bond and $27 million in savings the Justice administration said came from dissolving the former Department of Health and Human Resources into three new state agencies earlier this year. \nSeveral Democrats spoke against the proposal, expressing concern that the Justice administration had not provided details about where the savings were coming from and how the cut could effect state programs. West Virginia has the highest per capita rate of children in foster care in the nation. \nDemocrat Del. Kayla Young said she\u2019s never voted against a tax cut proposal during her time in the legislature, but the source of funding for this cut concerned her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable not knowing where this money is coming from,\u201d she said. \nHouse Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle said the tax cut won't make a meaningful impact on most working-class West Virginians' budgets \u2014 40 cents a week, or just under $21 a year. He said the trigger system included in the 2023 income tax bill is a more responsible approach, and questioned why the governor was pushing a further tax cut \u201coutside the scope of that in the 25th hour before the election.\u201d\n\u201cThe policy of it is it\u2019s taking money away from children,\u201d he said. \"And if we\u2019re going to do a tax cut, I would submit to this body that we \u2014 all of us \u2014 do a little bit more work and make sure that money is not going to affect children.\u201d \nRepublican Del. Larry Kump of Berkeley County said he disagreed that a 2% cut wouldn't be meaningful to families. He said he both grew up and lives in a working poor neighborhood, and has neighbors that have to make decisions between food and heat. \n\u201cEven a little bit is meaningful. A gallon of milk helps with a family,\u201d he said. \"Anything we can do to reduce the tax burden on our taxpayers is a good thing.\"\nA child and dependent tax credit passed by the state Legislature would allow people to receive a non-refundable credit of around $225 to apply to their taxes if they receive the federal child care tax credit, which is around $450 a year. Around 16,000 West Virginia families receive the federal child care tax credit.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/musks-reinstated-brazil-after-complying-supreme-court-demands-114618439", "Title": "Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 PM", "content": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\n\u201cX is proud to return to Brazil,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on its Global Government Affairs account. \"Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.\u201d\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/colombian-electoral-authorities-open-investigation-president-petros-2022-114618145", "Title": "Colombian electoral authorities open investigation against President Petro's 2022 campaign", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:22 PM", "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Electoral authorities in Colombia on Tuesday ruled in favor of investigating financial misconduct allegations against the 2022 campaign that got President Gustavo Petro elected.The investigation to be carried out by the National Electoral Council will focus on whether the campaign exceeded financing limits and whether it accepted funds from prohibited sources. The electoral body previously delayed deciding on the inquiry, which some, including Petro, see as politically motivated and illegal.\nThe outcome of the investigation could result in fines against some campaign staffers, including its auditors, treasurer and manager. It can't lead to an immediate impeachment of the president.\nThe council\u2019s decision came after two of its 10 magistrates presented a report alleging that Petro\u2019s presidential campaign exceeded financial limits by about $1.2 million. Petro has denied the accusations, which he has said are an initial effort by his adversaries to remove him from office.\nPetro responded to the council's decision with a brief message on X: \u201cThe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has begun,\u201d he wrote.

The statement also alleged that Petro\u2019s campaign received funds from \u201cprohibited sources of financing,\u201d including labor organizations.\nThe possibility of an investigation against the president generated a political and legal debate about the council\u2019s powers and presidential immunity.\nIn Colombia, only a commission of the House of Representatives can investigate the president. But the country's Council of State last month ruled that the president\u2019s immunity doesn't prevent him from being investigated by another government body such as the National Electoral Council, which can only impose financial penalties. The Council of State maintained that only Congress can impeach the president.\nNo president in Colombia has been removed from office in a political trial in Congress in the last 30 years.\nPetro\u2019s attorney, Hector Carvajal, last month told a radio station that he had already filed an appeal with the Council of State to reconsider its decision and clarify that the president\u2019s immunity is comprehensive, so he couldn't be investigated by electoral authorities. Carvajal warned that should electoral authorities open the investigation, he would file an appeal with Colombia's Constitutional Court and would also resort to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n____\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/major-us-stock-indexes-fared-tuesday-1082024-114617521", "Title": "How major US stock indexes fared Tuesday, 10/8/2024", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:20 PM", "content": "U.S. stocks rebounded as falling oil prices release some of the pressure that built up on the market.The S&P 500 rose 1% Tuesday and clawed back its loss from the day before.

The company does not admit to any liability in the settlement, which the EPA said is the largest amount ever sought for a refinery under a Clean Air Act rule that requires owners and operators to ensure that regulated and other extremely hazardous substances are managed safely.\nThe EPA found that the company failed to identify and assess hazards posed by a pipe elbow in a hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit at the refinery in Philadelphia.

At the time, it was the largest oil refining complex on the East Coast, processing 335,000 barrels of crude oil daily.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-guardians-brewers-twins-beginning-114617289", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Guardians, Brewers and Twins next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:51 PM", "content": "Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019.

The investigative nonprofit Housing Rights Initiative announced Tuesday that it has filed complaints with the California Civil Rights Department, alleging landlords violated a state law against denying leases to renters who pay with vouchers. It seeks penalties against 203 companies and individuals. \nThe nonprofit is also pushing for more state funding to adequately enforce the law, which Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2019. \n\u201cThis historic filing serves as an opportunity for the Governor and his housing enforcement agency to enforce the very bill he signed into law and hold violators accountable,\u201d the Housing Rights Initiative said in a statement. \nNewsom's office referred comment on the filing to the state Civil Rights Department. Rishi Khalsa, a department spokesperson, said the agency is \u201cdeeply committed to using the tools at its disposal to combat discrimination in housing.\u201d The department has reached more than 200 settlements related to similar discrimination in recent years, Khalsa said. \n\u201cWe always welcome additional support to strengthen enforcement of civil rights and we continue to work with a range of partners in those efforts,\u201d he said in an email Tuesday. \nThe goal of the Section 8 program, named for a component of the federal Housing Act, is to keep rental properties affordable and prevent homelessness, which has reached crisis levels in California. Under the program, which has a long waiting list, tenants typically pay about 30% of their income on rent, with the voucher covering the rest.\nOver the course of a year, undercover investigators posing as prospective tenants reached out via text messages to landlords, property managers and real estate agents to determine compliance with California's fair housing laws. The investigation found voucher holders were explicitly discriminated against 44% of the time in San Francisco. Voucher denials took place in 53% of cases in Oakland, 58% in San Jose, and 70% in Los Angeles.\nIn one text message exchange, an agent with EXP Realty, a national brokerage firm, tells an investigator posing as a prospective tenant that utilities are included in the monthly rate for a rental unit. When informed that the tenant has a Section 8 voucher, the agent responds, \u201cI don't work with that program,\" according to the investigation. \nIn another exchange, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty replies to an investigator posing as a hopeful renter, \u201cOh sorry, owner not accepting Section 8.\u201d\nRepresentatives for EXP and Sotheby's didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails seeking comment on the claims. \nKate Liggett, program director of Housing Rights Initiative, estimates the filing represents just a fraction of discrimination against Section 8 tenants in California. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/miltons-storm-surge-threat-devastating-tampa-bay-region-114611884", "Title": "Milton's storm surge is a threat that could be devastating far beyond the Tampa Bay region", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:52 PM", "content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene \u201cspared\u201d the Tampa Bay region a direct hit and yet storm surge still caused catastrophic damage, flooding homes, drowning people who decided to stay near the coast and leaving massive piles of debris that still sit along roadsides.Now that Hurricane Milton, a more powerful storm, is heading straight for the same region, what can residents expect?\n\u201cWorse. Much worse,\u201d said former Federal Emergency Management Director Craig Fugate, a Florida resident who previously ran the state's emergency management division. \nThe cities near the mouth of Tampa Bay saw some of the worst storm surge in memory during Helene even though the storm landed more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the north. Now forecasters say the low-lying region could be hit with 15 feet (5 meters) of storm surge.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t water that rises slowly. This is fast-moving water with waves. It\u2019s like a battering ram,\" Fugate said. \"You just don\u2019t want to be in that area. That\u2019s how we lost a lot of lives in all those surge areas where people didn\u2019t get out. They either drowned or were crushed by their houses collapsing on them.\u201d\nStorm surge is the level at which sea water rises above its normal level.\nMuch like the way a storm\u2019s sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn\u2019t include the wave height above the mean water level of the surge itself.\nSurge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at the time, so a 15-foot (5-meter) storm surge at high tide with 10-foot (3-meter) waves on top of that can level buildings with ease, knock down bridges and flatten anything in its path.\nFlorida's west peninsular coast contains the Tampa Bay region, though it's not just the city of Tampa that's at risk. St. Petersburg and densely populated barrier islands are on the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the bay. And the threat from storm surge extends about 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north into the state's Big Bend region and more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the south to Naples and into the Florida Keys.\nMilton will have an enormous impact no matter where it lands, but the worst surge will be to the south of Milton's eye. If that includes Tampa Bay and the 3.3 million people who live in the region, flooding could be catastrophic. The region hasn't had a direct hit from a major hurricane in more than 100 years.\nIf it hits to the south of Tampa Bay, cities like Sarasota, Venice, Fort Myers and Naples could be devastated just two years after Hurricane Ian caused catastrophic damage, washed away homes and businesses and made bridges to barrier islands impassable.\nState and local governments are moving as quickly as they can to remove storm tree limbs, furniture, appliances and other debris left in huge piles after Helene. But they won't get rid of all of it.\nWhile state and local officials fear Milton's wind and surge can turn debris into deadly projectiles, Fugate points out that it won't kill anybody if they evacuate and that property damage will be severe with or without debris blowing and washing around.\n\u201cI have the feeling everything that\u2019s still standing will become debris and you won\u2019t be able to distinguish it,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got enough water to move that stuff around, it\u2019s going to be moving houses, cars and other things as well.\u201d\nSure, Milton could weaken from a Category 5 to a Category 3 before landfall, but that won't make a big difference when it comes to storm surge.\n\u201cWind doesn\u2019t have memory, storm surge does. So, what a storm is doing a day out will have a lot of impact on storm surge,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cOnce that energy is in the water and your pushing it, even if you saw some weakening, it doesn\u2019t really change.\u201d\nAnd the area where Milton's heading has a large number of creeks, canals and rivers that will could cause problems beyond the immediate coast.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mcdonalds-sues-top-meat-packers-allegedly-colluding-inflate-114611453", "Title": "McDonald's sues top meat packers for allegedly colluding to inflate the price of beef", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:44 PM", "content": "NEW YORK -- McDonald\u2019s has some beef with today\u2019s largest meat packers.The fast food giant is suing the U.S. meat industry's \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef Packing Company \u2014 and their subsidiaries, alleging a price fixing scheme for beef specifically. In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads.

It's not clear how much of the settlement fund will be used up by those payments because the attorneys haven't provided those details. A federal judge approved the settlement last month.\nThe lawyers haven't provided any breakdown of how many of the roughly 55,000 claims they received are for injuries and how many are for property damage, nor have they said how much each person will receive. Only 370 households and 47 businesses opted out of the deal.\nResidents who lived within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the train crash that happened near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February 2023 were eligible to receive up to $25,000 apiece as long as they gave up the right to sue later if someone develops cancer or any other serious health condition.\nThe property damage portion of the settlement provides larger payments of up to $70,000 per household for those living within two miles (3.2 kilometers) of the derailment, with payments decreasing the further away people lived, up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) out.\nAbout the only payment that is relatively certain is the $162 million in legal fees the judge approved as part of the settlement. That won't change unless the deal is overturned on appeal.\nResidents don't really know exactly how much they will receive. Their claims are still being reviewed, and any settlement they get will be reduced by the amount of aid they accepted after the derailment when Norfolk Southern paid to relocate families and compensate some people for lost wages and damaged belongings. Plus, some lawyers who aren't representing the overall class are still demanding to collect a percentage of any settlement some residents receive.\nAt least $18 million has been consumed by administrative expenses, though the class lawyers now say that total will grow by at least $825,000 because the claims administrator will have to handle the personal injury payments separately from the property payments.\nThe initial appeal notice filed by the Rev. Joseph Sheely in the case was divisive in East Palestine, with some residents upset that their settlement checks will be delayed making threats. Then Sheely came forward publicly and said in interviews that he wanted no part in the appeal even though he was one of the small group of residents who questioned the deal this summer, casting doubt about the future of the appeal. \nOn Tuesday, four other area residents came forward and put their names on a notice saying they intend to appeal. They might face also complaints from their neighbors that they are just being greedy, but their lawyer, David Graham, said they are willing to take the heat to help ensure the deal is fair and addresses the town's needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good people who have stepped forward in the face of adversity and persecution that they know they\u2019re going to likely receive. And they stepped up to file this appeal,\" Graham said.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers filed a motion Monday asking the judge to order Sheely to post an $850,000 bond before his appeal could move forward. That may be moot now that the notice of additional appeals has been filed, but it's not clear whether the lawyers will ask all of the appellants to post a bond.\nThose who object to the deal say they felt rushed to accept it without ever receiving a full accounting of the contamination they were exposed to when tank cars full of hazardous chemicals spilled their contents or when officials decided to needlessly blow open five tank cars of vinyl chloride and burn that plastic ingredient. Some doubt the Environmental Protection Agency's assurances that their town is safe, and the plaintiffs' attorneys never disclosed what their own expert discovered when he tested for dioxins and other dangerous chemicals around East Palestine.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers reiterated in their motion Monday that even if residents feel like they have inadequate information about the dangers they face because of questions about the EPA response or the testing data the agency reports or the cleanup, they should be able to trust the lawyers because of the research they did and the experts they consulted.\nGraham said that the personal injury payment in particular seems woefully inadequate. He said residents will quickly rack up medical bills bigger than that payment if they develop any kind of serious health problems.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hunt-gasoline-adding-floridians-anxiety-milton-nears-114609527", "Title": "The hunt for gasoline is adding to Floridians\u2019 anxiety as Milton nears", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:02 PM", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida gas stations struggled to keep up with demand Tuesday as long lines and empty pumps compounded the stress for residents planning to hunker down or flee as Hurricane Milton approached the state's western coast.

Successful testing of the vehicles' ability to master a variety of traffic situations, Liu suggested, would strengthen the public's confidence in them.\nLiu said significant research is still needed before autonomous vehicles could be rolled out safely nationwide. But he said he agreed with their manufacturers that in the long run, self-driving vehicles could potentially save lives and improve the efficiency of the nation's transportation system.\nAt present, no specific federal regulations cover self-driving vehicles, and only a few states have their own such requirements. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation, has been gathering data about crashes involving autonomous vehicles. But it has so far issued only voluntary guidelines that don't include driving tests.\nMessages were left Tuesday seeking comment from the Transportation Department.\nSelf-driving cars still must meet federal safety standards that apply to all passenger vehicles, which means the government investigates them only after serious incidents.\n\u201cOur current safety regulation for vehicles is reactive, so we depend upon self-regulation,\u201d Liu said.\nAt the University of Michigan testing center, Liu runs a mock town, called Mcity, containing a traffic light and a roundabout that is used by companies and the government to test self-driving vehicles.\nA regulation, or perhaps a voluntary test, is needed because \u201cwe don't want to create a public hazard,\u201d said Liu, who made his remarks Tuesday and announced that Mcity can now be used by researchers remotely.\nLiu suggested that a driver's test should be able to determine whether a self-driving vehicle can make a left turn at an intersection without the protection of a traffic light with a green arrow. He said it should also ensure that the vehicle will halt at a stop sign and detect and yield to a small pedestrian crossing a road. \nA test, he said, would prevent a poorly performing robot vehicle from being turned loose on society, much as a human driver's test would keep an incompetent driver off the road. But he acknowledged that no test could prevent all crashes involving self-driving vehicles.\nThe driver's tests, Liu said, would help robot vehicle developers \u201cso that when they are moving in to deploy into the U.S., into certain cities, they will face less resistance from the cities.\"\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has long complained that federal regulation is impeding innovation. Tesla is developing a robotaxi system called \u201cFull Self-Driving,\" but the robotaxis cannot drive themselves, and Tesla owners who use them must be ready to intervene at any time. \nLiu said basic driving standards would actually contribute to innovation and enhance the deployment of autonomous vehicles. If companies are confident enough for large-scale deployment of their systems, he said, a basic competency test should be \u201csmall cake,\u201d for them to pass.\n\u201cSo why could this be a hindrance for the deployment?\u201d he asked.\nEurope and China, Liu noted, already have basic tests that put autonomous vehicles through third-party testing. But the U.S. has continued to rely on self-certification by the companies.\nLiu said he is acting now to propose the driver's test because autonomous vehicles are making progress in using \u201cmachine learning\u201d computers to make decisions on the road. He predicts that they will be widely deployed on U.S. roads in five to 10 years. \n\u201cLarge-scale deployment is on the horizon, and that's why the federal government should take action,\u201d Liu said.\nAlready, Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit of Alphabet Inc., is carrying passengers in vehicles without human safety drivers in Phoenix and other areas. General Motors' Cruise self-driving unit had been running robotaxis in San Francisco until a crash last year involving one of its vehicles.\nAlso, Aurora Innovation said it will start hauling freight in fully autonomous semis on Texas freeways by year's end. Another autonomous semi company, Gatik, plans to haul freight autonomously by the end of 2025. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nhtsa-investigating-enel-juicebox-residential-electric-vehicle-chargers-114604252", "Title": "NHTSA investigating some Enel X Way JuiceBox residential electric vehicle chargers", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:22 PM", "content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating complaints about some JuiceBox residential electric vehicle chargers after reports of fires and other electrical malfunctions as the manufacturer exits the market.

The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hungarys-orbn-interrupted-activist-eu-presidency-news-conference-114601065", "Title": "Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n interrupted by activist during EU presidency news conference", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 11:13 AM", "content": "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in the French city of Strasbourg on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

All of the complaints were filed in state courts. \nAt the heart of each lawsuit is the TikTok algorithm, which powers what users see on the platform by populating the app\u2019s main \u201cFor You\u201d feed with content tailored to people\u2019s interests. The lawsuits note TikTok design features that they say addict children to the platform, such as the ability to scroll endlessly through content, push notifications that come with built-in \u201cbuzzes\u201d and face filters that create unattainable appearances for users. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen profit over the health and safety, well-being and future of our children,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco. \"And that is not something we can accept. So we\u2019ve sued.\u201d\nThe latest lawsuits come nearly a year after dozens of states sued Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. in state and federal courts for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms. \nKeeping people on the platform is \u201chow they generate massive ad revenue,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in an interview. \u201cBut unfortunately, that\u2019s also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.\u201d\nThe legal challenges, which also include Google's YouTube, are part of a growing reckoning against social media companies and their effects on young people's lives. In some cases, the challenges have been coordinated in a way that resembles how states previously organized against the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. \nTikTok, though, is facing an even bigger obstacle, as its very existence in the U.S. is in question. Under a federal law that took effect earlier this year, TikTok could be banned from the U.S. by mid-January if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, doesn\u2019t sell the platform by then. Both TikTok and ByteDance are challenging the law at an appeals court in Washington. A panel of three judges heard oral arguments in the case last month and are expected to issue a ruling, which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn its filings Tuesday, the District of Columbia called the algorithm \u201cdopamine-inducing,\u201d and said it was created to be intentionally addictive so the company could trap many young users into excessive use and keep them on its app for hours on end. TikTok does this despite knowing that these behaviors will lead to profound psychological and physiological harms, such as anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia and other long-lasting problems, the district said.\nTikTok is disappointed that the lawsuits were filed after the company had been working with the attorneys general for two years on addressing to the issues, a spokesman said.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,\" the TikTok spokesman. Alex Haurek, said. \"We\u2019re proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we\u2019ve done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product.\u201d\nThe social media company does not allow children under 13 to sign up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children. \nThe District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \u201cunlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \u201cGifts\u201d to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn\u2019t registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.\nOfficials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok\u2019s LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \u201cvirtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation. \nThe 14 attorneys general say the goal of their lawsuits is to stop TikTok from using these features, impose financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collect damages for users that have been harmed.\nThe use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Almost all teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform, with about a third saying they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center.\nHigh school students who frequently use social media more commonly have persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, according to a new survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted last year in which about 20,000 teenagers participated.\nLast week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued TikTok, alleging the company was sharing and selling minors' personal information in violation of a new state law that prohibits these practices. TikTok, which disputes the allegations, is also fighting against a similar data-oriented federal lawsuit filed in August by the Department of Justice. \nSeveral Republican-led states, including Nebraska, Kansas, New Hampshire, Kansas, Iowa and Arkansas, also previously sued the company, some unsuccessfully, over allegations it is harming children's mental health, exposing them to \u201cinappropriate\u201d content or allowing young people to be sexually exploited on its platform. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dozen-states-sue-tiktok-claiming-platform-addictive-harms-114596399", "Title": "More than a dozen states sue TikTok, claiming its platform is addictive and harms the mental health of children", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 10:05 AM", "content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pepsico-lowers-revenue-forecast-weakening-demand-us-114588847", "Title": "PepsiCo lowers revenue forecast on \"subdued\" sales in US, China and elsewhere", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 6:09 AM", "content": "PepsiCo lowered its sales forecast for the year as consumers in the U.S., China and elsewhere continued to pull back on buying its snacks and drinks.The company, based in Purchase, New York, said Tuesday it now expects its organic revenue to increase in the low single-digit range for the year.

I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/inflation-returned-normal-election/story?id=114568961", "Title": "Inflation has returned to normal. What does that mean for the election?", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 5:07 AM", "content": "As the U.S. hurtles toward a presidential election this fall, the nation\u2019s inflation rate has quietly returned to normal, even as it continues to worry voters and draw focus at campaign events.More than half of adults list inflation as a top issue for the country, making it the highest-ranking concern by a wide margin over the likes of immigration, crime and abortion, according to an Ipsos poll conducted late last month.\nThe disconnect stems in part from a typical lag between when inflation comes down and when consumers acclimate to new price levels, since a lower inflation rate does not mean prices have come down but rather that they have begun to increase at a slower pace, experts told ABC News.\nWhile consumer attitudes have brightened in recent months, many people remain frustrated with the cumulative leap in prices over recent years. The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/facebook-youtube-tiktok-users-europe-forum-challenge-social-114587858", "Title": "Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users in Europe get forum to challenge social media content decisions", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 AM", "content": "LONDON -- Social media users in the European Union will soon have a new forum to challenge decisions by platforms to remove posts and videos for breaking their rules or leave up others that may violate them.An \u201cout of court dispute settlement body\u201d named the Appeals Center Europe said Tuesday it has been certified by Irish regulators to act as a referee on content moderation disputes across the 27-nation EU, starting with cases involving Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. \nThe center is similar to Meta\u2019s Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body set up in 2020 that acts like a supreme court for thorny decisions about content moderation issues on Facebook, Instagram and Threads submitted by users around the world. \nUnder the EU's digital rulebook known as the Digital Services Act, or DSA, tech companies and social media platforms are required to work with dispute settlement bodies and comply with any decisions they make. EU officials in Brussels wanted to give EU citizens a way to challenge any decisions made by Big Tech companies as they sought to balance the right to free speech against the goal of curbing online risks. \nThe center will hear appeals from users or groups located in the EU about \u201ceverything from violence and incitement to hate speech to bullying and harassment,\u201d CEO Thomas Hughes said. \n\u201cIt could be everything from a case that relates to a head of state all the way through to a neighborly dispute,\u201d Hughes said. \nThe Digital Services Act is a sweeping set of regulations that requires tech and social media companies operating in Europe to clean up their platforms under threat of hefty fines. \nThe Appeals Center, based in Dublin, where many Silicon Valley companies have their European headquarters, will start hearing cases from users before the end of the year. It's initially dealing with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users because it wanted to start with the biggest platforms, with plans to add others later. \nUnlike the Oversight Board, which can cherry pick the biggest and most important cases, the center will have to rule on every case it gets. And decisions won\u2019t be publicly available, unlike Oversight Board judgments that are posted online. \n The Oversight Board both issues binding decisions on individual cases, such as ruling in September on three separate posts with the controversial Palestinian rallying cry \u201c from the river to the sea,\" and also weighs in on wider policy issues with non-binding recommendations, such as guidance in July on updating Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfakes after reviewing a case involving deepfake intimate images of two women. \nThe Appeals Center\u2019s decisions, in contrast, aren't binding and will be limited to whether content such as a post, photo or video violates each platform\u2019s rules. \nHughes said the center will hire staff from across the EU to handle what he said could be up to tens of thousands of cases each year. The staff will have expertise in specific regions, languages and policy areas. \nBeyond the individual decisions on cases, data on the disputes will help regulators and researchers map out any \u201csystemic risks\u201d to social media users. \nThe Real Facebook Oversight Board, a group of civil rights leaders and tech experts that has been critical of Meta and its oversight panel, gave a cautious welcome to the new centre. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about the appeals center and how it will work, but moderation enforcement under the DSA has promise that other approaches do not,\" said spokesman Ben Wyskida. While the DSA \u201chasn't been perfect ... it is still far and away superior to anything in the United States.\u201d \nMeta's Oversight Board is providing 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in startup funding, said Hughes, who was previously the Oversight Board's director. He added that the two bodies will operate separately but will \u201cpoint in the same direction in terms of platform accountability and transparency, user rights\u201d and applying a human rights framework to online speech. \nThe Appeals Center will fund its ongoing operations by charging tech companies 95 euros for every case it hears, as well as a 5 euro fee from users who raise disputes. This \"nominal\" fee is intended to stop people from \u201cgaming or abusing\u201d the system and will be refunded if a user wins, Hughes said. \nEven though decisions aren't binding, users will still get their money back if the center rules in favor of their disputes, regardless of whether or not the platform takes any action.\nThere's a 90-day deadline for decisions, but in most cases they will be made much more quickly, he said. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hong-kongs-hang-seng-index-plunges-95-investors-114587667", "Title": "Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunges 9.5% as investors dump shares after recent sharp gains", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:06 AM", "content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nobel-prize-physics-awarded-2-scientists-discoveries-enabled-114589131", "Title": "Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:50 AM", "content": "STOCKHOLM -- Two pioneers of artificial intelligence \u2014 John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton \u2014 won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats for humanity.Hinton, who is known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton.\n\u201cThese two gentlemen were really the pioneers,\u201d said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce.\nThe artificial neural networks \u2014 interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain \u2014 the researchers pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and \u201chave also become part of our daily lives,\" said Ellen Moons of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nHopfield, whose 1982 work laid the groundwork for Hinton's, told The Associated Press, \u201cI continue to be amazed by the impact it has had.\"\nHinton predicted that AI will end up having a \u201chuge influence\u201d on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care.\n\u201cIt would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,\u201d he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\u201cWe have no experience of what it\u2019s like to have things smarter than us. And it\u2019s going to be wonderful in many respects,\u201d Hinton said. \n\u201cBut we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.\u201d\nThe Nobel committee also mentioned fears about the possible flipside. \nMoons said that while it has \"enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.\u201d\nHinton, who quit a role at Google so he could speak more freely about the dangers of the technology he helped create, shares those concerns.\n\u201cI am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,\u201d Hinton said.\nFor his part, Hopfield, who signed early petitions by researchers calling for strong control of the technology, compared the risks and benefits to work on viruses and nuclear energy, capable of helping and harming society. At a Princeton news conference, he made reference to the concerns, bringing up the dystopia imagined in George Orwell's \u201c1984,\u201d or the fictional apocalypse inadvertently created by a Nobel-winning physicist in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle.\u201d\nHopfield, who was staying with his wife at a cottage in Hampshire, England, said that after grabbing coffee and getting his flu shot, he opened his computer to a flurry of activity.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that many emails in my life,\u201d he said. A bottle of champagne and bowl of soup were waiting, he added, but he doubted there were any fellow physicists in town to join the celebration.\nHinton said he was shocked at the honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen,\u201d he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet.\nHinton, 76, helped develop a technique in the 1980s known as backpropagation instrumental in training machines how to \u201clearn\" by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It\u2019s similar to the way a student learns, with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network\u2019s version of reality.\nHinton had an unconventional background as a psychologist who also dabbled in carpentry and was genuinely curious about how the mind works, said protege Nick Frosst, who was Hinton\u2019s first hire at Google\u2019s AI division in Toronto.\nHis \u201cplayfulness and genuine interest in answering fundamental questions I think is key to his success as a scientist,\u201d Frosst said. \nNor did he stop at his pioneering 1980s work.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been consistently trying out crazy things and some of them work very well and some of them don\u2019t,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cBut they all have contributed to the success of the field and galvanized other researchers to try new things as well.\u201d \nHinton's team at the University of Toronto wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That spawned a flurry of copycats and was \u201ca very, very significant moment in hindsight and in the course of AI history,\u201d said Stanford University computer scientist and ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li.\n\u201cMany people consider that the birth of modern AI,\u201d she said.\nHinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science\u2019s top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019.\n\u201cFor a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,\u201d Hinton told the AP in 2019. \"My message to young researchers is, don\u2019t be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly.\u201d\nMany of Hinton's former students and collaborators followed him into the tech industry as it began capitalizing on AI innovations, and some started their own AI companies, including Frosst's Cohere and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Hinton said he uses machine learning tools in his daily life.\n\u201cWhenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT-4,\u201d Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not-very-good expert. And that\u2019s very useful.\u201d\nHopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. \nJust as Hinton came to the field from psychology, Hopfield stressed how cutting edge science comes from crossing the borders of scientific fields like physics, biology and chemistry instead of researchers staying in their lane. It's why this prize is a physics prize, he said, pointing out that his neural network borrows from condensed matter physics.\nWith big complex problems in scientific fields, \u201cif you are not motivated by physics, you just don't tackle the class of problems,\u201d Hopfield said.\nWhile there's no Nobel for computer science, Li said that awarding a traditional science prize to AI pioneers is significant and shows how boundaries between disciplines have blurred. \nNot all of their peers agree with the Nobel laureates about the risks of the technology they helped create.\nFrosst has had many \u201cspirited debates\u201d with Hinton about AI\u2019s risks and disagrees with some of Hinton\u2019s warnings but not his willingness to publicly address them.\n\u201cMostly we disagree on timescale and on the particular technology that he\u2019s sounding the alarm on,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that neural nets and language models as they exist today pose an existential risk.\u201d\nBengio, who has long voiced concerns about AI risks, said what really alarms him and Hinton is \u201closs of human control\u201d and whether AI systems will act morally when they're smarter than humans.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to these questions,\u201d he said. \"And we should make sure we do before we build those machines.\u201d\nAsked whether the Nobel committee might have factored in Hinton\u2019s warnings when deciding on the award, Bengio dismissed that, saying \u201cwe\u2019re talking about very early work when we thought that everything would be rosy.\u201d\nSix days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. They continue with the chemistry prize Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-imposes-provisional-tariffs-european-brandy-after-eu-114586979", "Title": "China puts provisional tariffs on European brandy after EU OKs duties on Chinese EVs", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:08 AM", "content": "BEIJING -- Chinese drinkers may pay more for Remy Martin and other European brandies after the government announced on Tuesday provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on those liquors, four days after a majority of European Union countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.The tit-for-tat move potentially gives Chinese negotiators leverage in talks with the EU on reducing or eliminating the tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese EVs, which would take effect at the end of this month.\nThe brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff, starting Friday. \nThe announcement followed a preliminary finding by China's Commerce Ministry in late August that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to domestic producers.\nChina has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products as a now year-old EU investigation into Chinese EV exports has progressed through various stages. \nThe brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac. France has supported the investigation into Chinese-made EVs, while Germany, whose automakers fear retaliation in the Chinese market, has opposed it. \nChina is studying whether to raise tariffs on imported cars with large engines, a Commerce Ministry spokesperson confirmed Tuesday in an online report from state broadcaster CCTV.\nThe provisional tariffs on brandy vary by brand, similar to the EU duties on electric cars made in China.

The piecemeal nature of the plans announced Tuesday appeared to disappoint investors who were hoping for bolder moves, and Shanghai's benchmark gave up a 10% initial gain as markets reopened after a weeklong holiday to trade just 3% higher. \nThe head of the National Development and Reform Commission said the government will frontload 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in spending from the government\u2019s budget for 2025 in addition to another 100 billion yuan for construction projects. \nThe scale of spending overall was well below the multi-trillion yuan levels that analysts said might be expected. \nThe NDRC\u2019s chairman, Zheng Shanjie, said China was still on track to attain its full-year economic growth target of around 5%. But he acknowledged the economy faces difficulties and an increasingly \u201cmore complex and extreme\u201d global environment.\nChina's leaders have been struggling to rev up growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended.

Those and other measures were the most aggressive efforts so far to try to pull the property industry out of the doldrums and spur faster growth. \nOn Tuesday, the NDRC said that new measures would focus on boosting investment and spending and supporting small and medium-sized businesses that operate at a disadvantage to large, state-corporations.\nBut much of the information focused on technical issues such as payment regulations, management of projects and deployment of bonds for financing. \nTo counter falling housing sales and home prices, Zheng said there would be \u201ccomprehensive policy measures to help stop the decline in the real estate market.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-chinese-shares-soar-fade-beijing-114585388", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street rebounds after Hong Kong stocks fall to worst day since 2008", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:44 PM", "content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rebounded Tuesday after falling oil prices released some of the pressure that built up on the market.The S&P 500 rallied 1% to claw back all of its loss from the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126 points, or 0.3%, and likewise neared its record set last week, while the Nasdaq composite led the way with a 1.4% rally.\nWall Street held firm even though stock markets around the world sank following scary swings in China, as euphoria about possible stimulus for the world\u2019s second-largest economy gave way to disappointment. Stocks tumbled 9.4% in Hong Kong for their worst day since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nHelping to support Wall Street was a sharp drawdown in oil prices. They gave back some of the big recent gains they made on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nA barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, fell 4.6% to $77.18 for its first loss in a week and a half. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, eased 4.6% to $73.57.\nThat also helped level off the pressure on the stock market from the bond market. Treasury yields eased a bit, a day after they shot to their highest levels since the summer.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 4.02 from 4.03% late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, slipped to 3.96% from 3.99%, late Monday, though it\u2019s still near its highest level since August.\nWhen Treasurys are paying higher yields, investors generally become less willing to pay very high prices for stocks and other investments. And Treasury yields had been storming higher over the last week following a suite of reports showing the U.S. economy remains healthier than expected.\nSuch reports, including one last week showing stronger hiring by U.S. employers  than forecast, raise hopes that the economy will avoid a recession. But they also force traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by, now that it has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation.\nTraders have abandoned expectations for the Fed to cut its main interest rate by a larger-than-usual half of a percentage point at its next meeting, for example. Instead, they\u2019re largely betting on a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. Some are even calling for the possibility the Fed could keep its main rate steady in November. \nHigh Treasury yields put the most pressure on stocks seen as the most expensive, and that puts the spotlight on the Big Tech stocks that have led the market for most of the last few years. \nOn Tuesday, all of the Big Tech stocks that have collectively come to be called the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d rose.

A top lieutenant for Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey opened what's expected to be multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments by attorneys for the state Insurance Department and the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies seeking the increase. \nIn over 2,000 pages of data filed last January, the Rate Bureau sought proposed increases varying widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to 99% in some beach areas. Proposed increases in and around big cities like Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro are roughly 40%. \nAcross 11 western counties that were hit hard by Helene, including Asheville's Buncombe County, the requested increase is 20.5%. The percentages are based on insurance payouts of years past and future claims projections.\nAfter taking public comment, Causey rejected the request in February, prompting the hearing. In previous rounds of premium rate requests, the industry and the commissioner have negotiated settlements before a hearing. Before the last such hearing set for early 2022, they settled weeks earlier on a 7.9% average premium rate increase after the bureau had sought 24.5%. \nThis time, Causey told reporters Monday, \u201cwe were not able to come anywhere close, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\nWhen the hearing ends, the hearing officer, in consultation with Causey, will decide within 45 days whether the proposed rates are excessive, and if so, issue an order that sets new rates. That order could be challenged at the state Court of Appeals. \nRate Bureau attorney Mickey Spivey told hearing officer Amy Funderburk that the highest inflation in 40 years \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms that are \"getting worse and worse\u201d show that current premium rates are \"severely inadequate.\" \nSpivey cited Helene, which inflicted unprecedented destruction in the state's western mountain communities, as well as Hurricane Florence in 2018, which caused billions of dollars of in damage in eastern North Carolina, much of it paid for by insurance companies. \nNot mentioned Monday: Hurricane Milton, which grew explosively to a Category 5 hurricane while closing in on Florida on a path expected to mostly miss North Carolina.\n\u201cWhether you want to call it climate change or not, there is no denying that we are having bigger, stronger and more costly catastrophic storms than we\u2019ve seen in any of our lifetimes,\u201d Spivey said. \nThe Insurance Department's attorney, Terence Friedman, argued that the industry continues to use actuarial methods that ignore what state law requires in calculating rates increases.\nFriedman said the bureau's requested rates are inflated and that the department's actuaries will demonstrate there are \u201dalternative recommended rates that will allow the bureau\u2019s members to earn what they\u2019re constitutionally entitled to.\" \nBut Spivey said the Insurance Department's witnesses would seek to actually lower premium rates, or limit increases by less than 3%. \nNot every owner's premiums will go up or down by the final approved rates; there are other factors insurers consider in setting a bill.\nWithout a fair profit and the ability to cover claims, Spivey said, industry companies will have to invoke a legal exception more frequently insuring high-risk homeowners only if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau's rate. Otherwise, he said, more insurers will stop issuing policies altogether. \nThe \u201cconsent to rate\u201d exception in North Carolina\u2019s law has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers, as some states have experienced, said David Marlett, an insurance professor at Appalachian State University. \nWhile each state has different models to regulate rates, those affected by more hurricanes and storms are essentially faced with two options, Marlett said: Allow rates to keep rising to cover claims, or \u201csomehow we build structures that are able to withstand climate change.\u201d\nFriedman criticized the bureau for citing Helene in its opening statement, saying it shouldn\u2019t be used as grounds to raise rates on the storm\u2019s survivors. He also noted that most of Helene's damage was caused by flooding, which is covered separately from the homeowners' policies now being considered.\nThe proceedings are likely to continue after early voting begins on Oct. 17. Causey, a two-term Republican commissioner, is being challenged by Democrat Natasha Marcus, a state senator. \nMarcus held a news conference outside the Insurance Department headquarters criticizing Causey for declining to preside over the hearing, calling it a \u201cridiculous dereliction of one of his major duties in this job.\u201d She also lamented that any decision will be made after Election Day. \nCausey said he's not hearing the case in part because he\u2019s not an attorney. State law allows him to pick someone else to preside over the hearing, which is a quasi-judicial proceeding. \n__\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/federal-judge-orders-google-open-android-app-store-114574997", "Title": "Federal judge orders Google to open its Android app store to competition", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 4:26 PM", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire. The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/major-us-stock-indexes-fared-monday-1072024-114574881", "Title": "How major US stock indexes fared Monday, 10/7/2024", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 4:25 PM", "content": "U.S. stocks slid after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 fell 1% Monday, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week ago.

The program was an inspiration for Gentry, who had launched a college-access program in rural eastern Kentucky about a decade earlier.\u201cWe realized that college access actually starts at birth,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cIt starts with the family, and it starts with the place.\u201d She and her staff soon began to modify their approach.\nA breakthrough came that year when Gentry\u2019s group \u2014 today called Partners for Rural Impact, or PRI \u2014 received a Promise Neighborhood grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The federal effort helps communities design anti-poverty projects modeled after the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone\u2019s \u201ccradle-to-career\u201d approach. PRI became one of the first organizations, and the first rural effort, to receive the grant.\nToday, the organization helps leaders in rural towns and districts identify programming gaps and tap into comprehensive educational, medical, and social services \u2014 largely funded by federal grants. It measures community progress across a indicators like kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading, eighth-grade math, and high school graduation rates. Many of those areas saw substantial improvement over the past decade, although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted progress.\nNow two funders \u2014 the Ballmer Group and Blue Meridian Partners \u2014 along with regional grantmakers and individual donors, are supporting PRI to adapt the model it honed in Appalachia for rural places in Texas, Missouri, and beyond.\n\u201cIt quickly became clear to us that Dreama\u2019s vision for this field and this work was much broader than what she was doing in Appalachia,\u201d says Cecilia Gutierrez, a managing director at Blue Meridian Partners.\nThe grantmaker gave PRI $2 million in 2023 for its work in Kentucky. Now a second two-year grant of $5 million is helping the nonprofit assist other rural communities to develop partnerships among schools, local governments, health-care systems, and other sectors to improve the lives of students.\nRural areas tend to have fewer and less accessible institutional resources than suburban or urban places, says Jeff Edmondson, executive director of community impact at the Ballmer Group. For that reason, he says, the role of an organization that helps keep a diverse group of community leaders on track to meet common goals is particularly important \u201cto ensure that they\u2019re using very limited resources as efficiently and effectively as possible.\u201d\nThis year, the Ballmer Group committed $12.5 million over five years to support PRI\u2019s efforts to assist other regions in forging community partnerships that help improve the lives of students. That\u2019s in addition to the $2.58 million the Ballmer Group has contributed to PRI since 2022.\nIn the past year, PRI began working in two towns in rural East Texas and Mexico, Missouri, the hometown of Tyronn Lue, head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. Lue provided $2.5 million to support that work alongside Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and Ballmer Group founder who owns the NBA team.\nOver the next four and a half years, PRI plans to identify two more regions or towns to launch locally led partnerships. The idea is that these communities, along with those in Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas, will serve as \u201cproof of concept\u201d for what can work to improve education outcomes for rural families, says Gentry. \u201cOur goal is that a superintendent in a rural place who\u2019s really considering doing a collective impact, place-based partnership could say, \u2018Hey, we see ourself in one of those five places and recognize that works in rural America.\u2019\u201d\nNo matter where PRI sets up shop, the work is led by locals, Gentry says.\nPRI Appalachia has a service area that spans 31 counties and 42 school districts. In Leslie County, where executive director Amon Couch was born and his father worked in the coal mines, the population is declining as people leave for better economic opportunities. The school system serves around 1,500 students, down from more than 3,500 students 30 years ago.\nTransportation is a major challenge as population density declines, and the area is a resource desert in terms of health and dental care. \u201cThe needs of our students are the greatest they\u2019ve ever been, financially,\u201d says Brett Wilson, the district superintendent. Around 70% of students receive some type of public assistance.\nLast year, the district transported hundreds of students to dental checkups through a partnership with a local health system and using money from a grant through the Department of Education\u2019s Full-Service Community Schools program and a local philanthropy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t learn English or math or anything else when your teeth are throbbing,\u201d Couch says.\nFederal and state grants will always be PRI\u2019s bread and butter, Gentry says. \u201cPublic dollars should support education,\u201d she says. Today Partners for Rural Impact\u2019s budget is around $78.2 million, with 78% coming from the government.\nIt\u2019s often a challenge for rural communities to come up with the matching funds some federal grants require. But philanthropy helps fill in the gaps, providing matching dollars to pay the 60 or so AmeriCorps members who work with PRI in a given year.\nRural areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting philanthropy.\nA 2015 U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis found that from 2005 to 2010, rural areas received just 5 to 6% of foundation grant dollars. A 2021 FSG report found that share increased marginally to 7%, even though those communities account for 14 to 20% of the population. depending on the definition of \u201crural.\u201d\nGrantmakers\u2019 focus on how many people they can serve always puts rural groups at a disadvantage, Gentry says. But she\u2019s successfully made the case that while total population numbers may be lower, donors can have a deeper impact outside of urban areas.\n\u201cYour scale could be doing the same intervention in multiple rural places around the country,\u201d she says.\nIn rural East Texas, the T.L.L. Temple Foundation has committed $2 million over five years with an additional $1 million in matching funds to help PRI establish a presence in Diboll and Pineland.\n\u201cThe issues we deal with in rural communities are very similar to what you see in urban communities \u2014 transportation, access to health care, access to child care, food deserts, lack of broadband,\u201d says Wynn Rosser, the foundation\u2019s president. \u201cThe issues just express themselves differently when the context is rural and remote.\u201d\nThe foundation is the region's largest grantmaker, with wealth from the Temple family, who owned a lumber and paper manufacturing company. It has long funded efforts to increase rates of third-grade literacy and math and help more high school students earn postsecondary credentials aligned to the region\u2019s labor market.\nAlready, PRI has helped bring together schools, colleges, nonprofits, and other community programs to work toward common goals and attract new federal funding, Rosser says. \u201cTheir method works, their leadership works, their belief in rural people and rural communities, all those things are already coming through.\u201d\n_____\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-rules-ftc-proceed-antitrust-lawsuit-amazon-tosses-114569981", "Title": "Judge rules the FTC can proceed with antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, tosses out few state claims", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:08 PM", "content": "A federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission can proceed with its landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy. \nHere is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling. \nLassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It\u2019s a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\nDiarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract \u201cwith just cause\u201d and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv.\nFree movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU\u2019s top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement.\nThe court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc\u2019s competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing \u201ccross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.\u201d\nThe ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied \u201cthat the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,\u201d Diarra\u2019s lawyers claimed \u201ctotal victory.\u201d\nThe judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally. \nSome analysts have compared it to the ECJ\u2019s 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause. \nFor now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThe decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,\u201d said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players \u2014 but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.\"\nIt took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited. \nA major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries \u2013 money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees. \nSpending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard.\nThe influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry\u2019s health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career \u201care an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,\u201d the ECA noted.\nThe soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices.\nFIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline. \nWithin hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation.\nEuropean Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA\u2019s Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is \u201cbecoming legally essential.\u201d\nFIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul. \nDiarra\u2019s lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont \u2014 who also represented Bosman 30 years ago \u2014 sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming \u201call professional players have been affected by these illegal rules\u201d and could now seek compensation.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/supreme-court-hear-appeal-elon-musks-platform-warrant-114564610", "Title": "Supreme Court won't hear appeal from Elon Musk\u2019s X platform over warrant in Trump case", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:09 AM", "content": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said Monday it won\u2019t hear an appeal from the social media platform X over a search warrant prosecutors obtained in the election-interference case against former President Donald Trump.The justices did not explain their reasoning and there were no noted dissents. \nThe company, known as Twitter before it was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk, says a nondisclosure order that blocked it from telling Trump about the warrant obtained by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team violated its First Amendment rights. \nThe company also argues Trump should have had a chance to exert executive privilege.

After the talks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will offer financial support to the cash-strapped Maldives in form of a $100-million treasury bills rollover. The countries also signed a $400-million currency swap agreement.\nThe two leaders virtually inaugurated a new runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport in the Maldives, and Modi announced that work will be accelerated on the India-assisted Greater Male Connectivity Project, which aims to link key islands of the Maldives through modern transport networks.\n\u201cIndia is Maldives\u2019 nearest neighbour and a close friend,\u201d Modi said during a joint news conference.

Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. In May, New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers with civilian experts.\nIn January, Maldivian leaders lashed out at Modi for promoting India\u2019s Lakshadweep archipelago for Indian travelers. Lakshadweep is off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland.\nMaldivians saw the move as a way to lure Indian tourists away from their country. It sparked angry protests from Indian celebrities who called for a tourism boycott to the Maldives. Tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives\u2019 economy. \nThe dispute deepened when Muizzu visited China ahead of India in January, a move seen by New Delhi as a snub. On his return, Muizzu spelled out plans to rid his tiny nation of dependence on India for health facilities, medicines and import of staples. \nA thaw ensued after Muizzu attended Modi\u2019s June swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi for a third five-year term.

They materialize from villages and form a crowd around the vehicle, watching closely as crews weigh and load the crated fruits. Such roadside exchanges, repeated regularly during peak harvest season, long provided a ready market for smallholder avocado growers in a country that\u2019s sometimes ranked as the world\u2019s poorest. But the transactions now promise real earnings thanks in part to the intervention of the national government and farmers\u2019 cooperatives that worked to set terms for foreign avocado dealers. \nJust a year ago, farmers selling their avocados to the transporters earned 10 cents per kilogram (2.2 pounds), far less than the price for a small bottle of water. These days, they get roughly 70 cents for the same quantity, a meaningful increase for people who mainly farm to feed their families. \nA major change in the trade is that payments in U.S. currency now go into the bank accounts of cooperatives that pay their members directly almost as soon as the avocado haulers leave. Acting as intermediaries, groups such as Green Gold Burundi, which has its headquarters in the northern province of Kayanza and represents 200,000 farmers nationwide, say they are better positioned than individual growers to stem exploitation.\nThe participation of the cooperatives is an important step toward regulating the country's avocado exports, said Ferdinand Habimana, vice president of Green Gold Burundi\u2019s administrative board. Although the government is promoting avocado farming to diversify exports, avocados grown in Burundi are yet to be trademarked as coming from there, he said. \n\u201cSo it is legally done now, but what we are developing now is that the (avocados) can reach the final destination as avocados taken from Burundi,\u201d said Habimana, speaking of his group\u2019s dealings with exporters in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. \nZacharie Munezero, who oversees quality management for Green Gold Burundi, acknowledged that the 70 cents farmers earn for a kilogram of avocados is still insufficient when exporters can fetch between $3 and $5 for the same quantity in international markets.\nAvocados are cheap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be purchased from farmers in bulk for almost nothing. In Burundi, avocados became more widely cultivated after the country's former leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, started extolling the fruit in 2007 as a source of nutrition and income. \nMany households that don\u2019t produce the varieties favored by exporters usually look after at least one avocado plant of the local variety known to Burundians as \u201camapeter,\u201d in remembrance of Nkurunziza, who died in 2020.\nBut while coffee and tea exports \u2013 Burundi\u2019s traditional sources of much-needed foreign currency \u2013 have long been coordinated, the trade in Burundian avocados has remained unregulated, according to farmer representatives and a trade official. They said that avocado exports could be as profitable for the country as coffee if the government asserted its rule-making authority. \nDesirable measures include guaranteeing a minimum price for farmers, stopping foreign traders from dealing directly with farmers, and encouraging widespread cultivation of the Hass avocados favored by European consumers, they said.\nBurundi \u201ccannot rely only on coffee and tea,\u201d Onesime Niyukuri, an adviser in the foreign trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said of the country's limited exports.\nIf avocado dealers from elsewhere in East Africa \u201ccan come and buy at a price that is already set by the government, there is no problem,\u201d he said.\nThe government ramped up its efforts to organize avocado exports earlier this year as dollar shortages fueled sporadic shortages of sugar and other goods. \nUnder new regulations, which require foreign dealers to register with local authorities, exporters must submit copies of their supply contracts and specify market destinations for Burundian avocados, according to the Ministry of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism. \nBurundi aims to export more than 10 million tonnes (11 million tons) of avocados each year by 2030, said Niyukuri, citing the government\u2019s strategic plan. Recent figures on Burundi\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from the avocado crop were not readily available.\nThe government\u2019s target is to plant 50,000 avocado trees in each of Burundi\u2019s 17 provinces. Local authorities in provinces such as Kayanza want each household to own at least 10 trees producing exportable avocados. \nThat includes the Mexican variety Fuerte and especially Hass avocado, the most commercially successful variety globally. The fruit, which has dark bumpy skin and bright yellow-green flesh, takes more than two weeks to ripen and can survive several days in transit. \nBurundi, a small mountainous country about the size of Maryland, is home to 13 million people. Annual income per capita was $199 in 2023, among the lowest globally, and nearly 65% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to World Bank figures.\nAgriculture is the main economic activity, and many people in rural provinces such as Kayanza mostly grow the potatoes and vegetables they will consume through the year. For some, including those with a few avocado trees in their compounds, the pear-shaped green fruit has proven a surprisingly reliable source of income.\nEric Nsabimana, a farmer in Kayanza, recalled starting as an avocado grower in response to the campaign of former leader Nkurunziza. Some farmers, feeling forced into planting avocados, uprooted the seedlings the government gave them and now rue the missed opportunity, Nsabimana said. \n\u201cThe people who didn\u2019t plant, they regret,\u201d he said.\nNsabimana, who anticipates making more than $6,000 a year selling avocados now that the price is higher, said he used his earnings to acquire five more hectares (12.4 acres) of land now planted with 500 avocado trees.\nHabimana, the senior official with Green Gold Burundi, said his group moved to mobilize avocado farmers for better rewards after it realized at the beginning of the year they were being exploited by foreign traders.\nOne day in January, he followed a truck transporting Burundian avocados to neighboring Tanzania, believing the cargo was destined for consumption in the region. When he saw the avocados getting washed, weighed and packed in the town of Njombe, he realized the goods were bound for another export market abroad. \n\u201cThere was another destination somewhere else, not in Njombe,\u201d Nsabimana said.\nWhen he returned to Kayanza, Green Gold Burundi prioritized plans to register avocado farmers in a way that eliminated middlemen and guaranteed a reasonable price for farmers. The cooperative pays taxes and keeps a cut of avocado proceeds to sustain operations that include providing members with seedlings and organic manure. \nMunezero, the cooperative's quality management official, said that while the price of avocados \u201cis still a problem,\u201d his group is \u201cfocusing on capacity building\" and encouraging residents to plant more avocado trees. \nGreen Gold Burundi has distributed millions of seedlings in the past year, finding enthusiasm among farmers eager to join the avocado bandwagon. Even growers with only a few backyard Hass plants said they increasingly see avocado as a cash crop. \n\u201cAvocados mean dollars to us,\u201d one such grower, Samuel Niyinyibutsa, said, adding that he knows some Kayanza residents who feel \u201cleft behind\u201d when they see others collect payments for their produce.\n\u201cBut they still have time,\u201d Niyinyibutsa said. \u201cThey can be awakened and start planting avocados because avocado can do well to them as it is doing well to us.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-asian-shares-climb-after-blockbuster-114552440", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street slides after Treasury yields climb back above 4% and oil rises", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 12:43 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks slid Monday after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"}]

But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cbs-news-trump-campaign-shifting-explanations-snubbed-60-114617380", "Title": "CBS News says Trump campaign had 'shifting explanations' for why he snubbed '60 Minutes'", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:12 PM", "content": "NEW YORK -- CBS News said the Trump campaign offered \u201cshifting explanations\u201d for why it backed out of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview special with presidential candidates that aired without him.The network's Scott Pelley appeared on the air Monday night to explain why Republican Donald Trump did not appear on what has become a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d tradition: back-to-back interviews with presidential candidates in the last month of the campaign.\nHarris was on the show, interviewed by Bill Whitaker. Where Trump was supposed to appear, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d instead aired a story about an Arizona official pushing false claims about election fraud.\nPelley said that the Trump campaign \u201ccomplained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story.\u201d\nThe Trump team also demanded an apology for his interview during the 2020 campaign, where he claimed that correspondent Lesley Stahl said a laptop computer belonging to President Joe Biden's son Hunter came from Russia. \u201cShe never said that,\u201d Pelley said.\nPelley said that Trump's team had agreed to an interview at the former president's Mar-a-Lago home, with an additional talk in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he returned to the scene of a July assassination attempt.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u201cbegged for an interview.\u201d The campaign did have concerns about the show's reporting on Hunter Biden and how it insisted upon editing Trump's comments, he said.\n\u201cThere was nothing scheduled or agreed upon,\" Cheung said. \u201dWe had already long promised an exclusive in filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out the be Fox News.\"\nTrump's interview with Fox's Laura Ingraham aired an hour before \"60 Minutes\" on Monday night. His absence from CBS was not mentioned in their exchange. Trump apparently, watched, however, posting on Truth Social that the Harris interview \u201cis considered by many of those who reviewed it, the WORST interview they have ever seen.\u201d\nPelley poked at Trump, noting he had already turned down another opportunity to debate Harris, along with the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, \u201cwhich may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and election day.\u201d\nMoving \u201c60 Minutes\u201d out of its traditional Sunday time slot may have depressed the audience size, however. An estimated 5.4 million people watched on Monday, according to preliminary Nielsen company figures, compared with the 9.6 million who saw the newsmagazine on Sunday, Sept. 29.\nNo estimate for Trump's audience on Ingraham's show was immediately available. Her show averaged 2.7 million viewers a night last week, Nielsen said.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-guardians-brewers-twins-beginning-114617288", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Guardians, Brewers and Twins next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:51 PM", "content": "Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.\n___\nAP sports writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and Steve Megargee in Milwaukee contributed to this story.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-cleveland-milwaukee-minnesota-beginning-114616889", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Cleveland, Milwaukee and Minnesota beginning next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:47 PM", "content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/interview-tough-cbs-news-grappling-question-after-dokoupil-114615670", "Title": "When is an interview too tough?

Yet a week after it took place, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil's pointed interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates about Israel remains the subject of heated conversations at the network and beyond.CBS management took the unusual step of scolding Dokoupil before his colleagues for not living up to network standards, in a private meeting Monday that quickly became public, and \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d staff continued to discuss it on Tuesday.\nThe seven-minute interview on Sept. 30 was about Coates' new book of essays, and Dokoupil zeroed in right away on a section about Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank in an exchange the Washington Post last week called \u201cunusually tense and substantive.\u201d\nFor all of Coates\u2019 honors as a writer, Dokoupil said that the essay \u201cwould not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.\u201d He wondered why Coates\u2019 writing did not include references to Israel being surrounded by enemies that want to eliminate the country.\n\u201cIs it because you just don\u2019t believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?\u201d he asked.\nCoates said there was no shortage of places where Israel's viewpoint is represented, and that he wanted to speak for those who don't have a voice.\n\u201cI wrote a 260-page book,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt is not a treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\u201d\nDokoupil later asked Coates about what offended him about the existence of a Jewish state, and he said that Palestinians \u201cexist in your narrative merely as victims of Israel,\u201d as if they had not been offered peace in any juncture. \nCoates said that he was offended when anyone \u2014 including the Palestinians who talked to him for his book \u2014 are treated as second-class citizens in the country where they live, comparing it to the Jim Crow-era United States where his ancestors grew up.\nIn the staff call on Monday, CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and her deputy, Adrienne Roark, said several journalists in the company had reached out to them about the interview.\n\u201cThere are times we have not met our editorial standards,\u201d Roark said, citing Dokoupil's interviews and other comments made by CBS personnel that she did not identify.\nCBS News is built on a \u201cfoundation of neutrality,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to serve our audience without bias or perceived bias.\u201d\nShe said that the problems had been addressed, but neither she nor CBS explained what this meant.\nMcMahon told staff members on the call that she expected its contents would remain confidential. But a tape of it was posted within hours on The Free Press news site.\nDokoupil did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Coates did not return a message.\nDokoupil is one of three \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d hosts, along with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. All three participated in the interview with Coates, but with the exception of an opening question by Burleson and a brief one at the end by King, it was dominated by Dokoupil.\nDokoupil is married to NBC News journalist Katy Tur. He has two children from a previous marriage who both live with their mother in Israel. In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Dokoupil said on the show that, \u201cas a father, I think people can understand if somebody, anybody, is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard to whether they are struck or not, you're going to feel a thing or two.\u201d\nThe rebuke by CBS management Monday came on the first anniversary of the Hamas attack.\nManagement received immediate pushback on the call from Jan Crawford, CBS News' chief legal correspondent, who said that it's a journalist's obligation to ask tough questions when somebody comes on the air to present a one-sided view.\n\u201cI don't see how we can say that failed to meet our editorial standards,\u201d Crawford said. She said she worried that it would make her think twice when conducting interviews.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/disney-world-universal-orlando-remain-open-ahead-hurricane-114604792", "Title": "Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld will all close ahead of Milton", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:36 PM", "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Orlando\u2019s tourism machine began grinding to a halt Tuesday with at least three major theme parks and the main airport announcing closures ahead of Hurricane Milton \u2019s expected hit as a major storm in Florida.Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld will close their theme parks and respective entertainment facilities on Wednesday, with the latter two also closed on Thursday and Disney likely to remain closed.\nUniversal also canceled Halloween Horror Nights scheduled for both days.\nThe theme parks join Orlando International Airport, which said it would cease operations Wednesday morning. The airport is the nation\u2019s seventh busiest and Florida\u2019s most trafficked.\nDisney World had said earlier in the day that it was open and planned only to close its campgrounds and rental cabins ahead of the storm.\nThe only indication at Disney Springs that a hurricane was coming had been the closure of a hot air balloon ride. \u201cClosed due to hurricane,\u201d an electronic sign read. \u201cStay safe.\u201d\nAll the other stores and restaurants in the outdoor shopping, dining and entertainment complex inside the resort were open and doing brisk business.\nMilton, which is expected to come ashore Wednesday, threatened to ruin the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists at Disney World. \nNicole and Zeb Downs arrived on Monday after a 21-hour drive from Arkansas, expecting a 12-day Florida vacation with their three young sons. By Tuesday afternoon, they were contemplating packing up their car and heading back.\n\u201cWe are disappointed but it\u2019s kind of out of our hands at this point,\u201d said Zeb Downs as he strolled with his family along a still-bustling Disney Springs shopping and restaurant district at the park resort.\nNeither of them had experienced a hurricane before and weren\u2019t sure they wanted to try it.\nThe Orlando area is the most visited destination in the United States due to Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and other theme parks, attracting 74 million tourists last year alone. \nOctober is also among the busier times for theme parks because of Halloween-related celebrations, which have become major money generators over the past couple decades. Universal Orlando hosts \u201cHalloween Horror Nights,\u201d with ghoulish haunted houses based on slasher films and other pop culture horror, and Disney has its tamer \u201cMickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party.\u201d\nWhile Disney rarely shuts its doors \u2014 save for dangerous hurricanes in recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 its hotels are often havens for coastal residents fleeing impending storms. A check of Disney World\u2019s online reservation system on Tuesday morning showed no vacancies.\nThose lucky enough to get a hotel reservation have gotten unexpected treats during past storms. During Hurricane Irma in 2017, guests at a hotel on Disney property found themselves stranded with actor Kristen Bell, who voiced the role of Anna in the beloved Disney film \u201cFrozen.\u201d While in Orlando, the actor found time to sing songs for evacuees at a nearby hurricane shelter.\nOnce a hurricane passes, the theme parks try to return operations to normal as quickly as possible. After Hurricane Charley charted a devastating path through Orlando in 2004, Disney World had utility vehicles picking up downed tree limbs and clearing roads on its property within an hour in the pitch-dark night.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/las-vegas-blow-kiss-goodbye-literally-tropicana-flashy-114605443", "Title": "Las Vegas will blow a kiss goodbye \u2014 literally \u2014 to the Tropicana with a flashy casino implosion", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:11 PM", "content": "LAS VEGAS -- Sin City will quite literally blow a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that will reduce to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip.The Tropicana's hotel towers are expected to tumble in 22 seconds at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/us-audiobooks-top-10-114603002", "Title": "US-Audiobooks-Top-10", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:05 PM", "content": "Nonfiction 1.

The aide, whom Woodward doesn\u2019t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed.\nTrump senior adviser and longtime aide Jason Miller told Woodward that he had not heard Trump was having calls with Putin and said, \u201cI'd push back on that.\u201d But Miller also said, according to the book, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d know how to get in touch with each other.\"\nSteven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said none of the stories in Woodward\u2019s books are true. In a statement on Tuesday, he called them \u201cthe work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\nTrump's relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.\nU.S. intelligence agencies later determined that Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump, though an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. In 2018, Trump publicly questioned that finding following an in-person meeting with Putin in Helsinki.\nIn recent years, Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia\u2019s invasion. He has said Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine.\nWoodward reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020.\nPutin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn\u2019t care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone.\nThe book doesn\u2019t specify when the machines were sent but describes it as being when the virus spread rapidly through Russia. It was previously reported by The Associated Press and other agencies that Trump\u2019s administration in May 2020 sent ventilators and other equipment to several countries, including Russia.\nVice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d at a time when \u201ceveryone was scrambling\" to get tests. \n\u201cThis person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,\" said Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.\nThe book also details Biden\u2019s complicated relationship with Netanyahu as well as private moments when the president has been fed up with him over the Israel-Hamas war.\nBiden\u2019s \u201cfrustrations and distrust\u201d of Netanyahu \u201cerupted\u201d this past spring, Woodward writes. The president privately unleashed a profanity-laden tirade, calling him a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and a \u201cbad f\u2014\u2014\u2014 guy,\" according to the book. Biden said he felt, in Woodward\u2019s accounting, that Netanyahu \u201chad been lying to him regularly.\u201d With Netanyahu \u201ccontinuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas.\u201d Woodward wrote, \u201cBiden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipment.\u201d\nBiden and Netanyahu have long been acquainted, although their relationship has not been known to be close or overly friendly. Last week, Biden said he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nAsked about the book's reporting, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons told reporters Tuesday that \u201cThe commitment that we have to the state of Israel is ironclad.\u201d\nSimons, when pressed on the details, said she wouldn't comment on every anecdote that may come out in reporting. She added of Biden and Netanyahu: \u201cThey have a long-term relationship. They have a very honest and direct relationship, and I don\u2019t have a comment on those specific anecdotes.\u201d\nThe book details Biden\u2019s criticism late last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of Putin\u2019s earlier invasion of Ukraine, when Russia seized Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat\u2019s vice president.\n\u201cThey f----- up in 2014,\u201d Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \u201cBarack never took Putin seriously.\u201d\nBiden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they \u201cnever should have let Putin just walk in there\u201d in 2014 and that the U.S. \u201cdid nothing.\u201d\nWoodward reports Biden was privately furious with Attorney General Merrick Garland for appointing a special counsel to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter in a tax-and-gun prosecution.\n\u201cShould never have picked Garland,\u201d Biden told an associate, according to Woodward. The journalist did not name the associate.\nHunter Biden was convicted in June on federal gun charges and faces sentencing in federal court in Delaware in December. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in California and is also set to be sentenced in that case in December.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\nOne of Trump\u2019s longest-term allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, blamed Trump\u2019s ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged to a cult of personality in which the former president\u2019s ensconcement at Mar-a-Lago and circle of aides and advisers \u201cconstantly feed this narrative,\u201d according to the book. \nThe weekend after Russia invaded Ukraine, Graham was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which the senator characterized as \u201ca little bit like going to North Korea.\u201d Graham added that \u201ceverybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.\u201d\nOn politics, Woodward wrote that Graham\u2019s counsel was part of what persuaded Trump to run again for the presidency.\nIn March, during one of his many visits to the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Graham told Woodward that he had been meeting with the Saudi crown prince when Graham suggested they call Trump. From \u201ca bag containing about 50 burner phones,\u201d Prince Mohammed \u201cpulled out one labeled \u2018TRUMP 45.\u2019\u201d On another trip, Woodward wrote, the Saudi leader retrieved another burner phone, \"this time labeled JAKE SULLIVAN \u201d when the men called Biden\u2019s national security adviser.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/apple-tv-app-top-movies-114603001", "Title": "Apple TV app - Top Movies", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:00 PM", "content": "Top Movie Purchases and Rentals (US):1.

CNN news anchor Chris Wallace starts the book in January 1960, when U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts declared his candidacy for the presidency during a divided time in United States politics. We are introduced to mobsters, Hollywood movie stars, labor bosses and Cuba's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.\nIt was the year that U.S. presidential campaigns entered the modern era, with televised debates and slick advertising, The achingly close contest was not unlike the current lead-up to the 2024 election pitting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump.\nLike now, there were charges of voter fraud and a stolen election. The results were so tight that Americans stayed up well past midnight to hear the final count.\nThe book is the latest in Wallace's \u201cCountdown\u201d series of popular histories, following his best-selling \u201cCountdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World,\u201d and \u201cCountdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice.\u201d\nThis time, Wallace, the son of CBS broadcaster Mike Wallace, takes us behind the scenes to view the machinations of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that led to Kennedy's nomination over Lyndon B. Johnson, later chosen as his running mate. Kennedy went on to become the first Catholic and youngest person elected U.S. president. \nKennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard M. Nixon, who ultimately decided not to contest the results despite reports of voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas. He said he could not think of a worse example for young nations trying to adopt free elections. \nAs we approach another consequential election this year, the book is a reminder of how 1960 was also a deeply perilous time for America. It also was a moment the nation survived because of patriotism and courage.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/qantas-airways-apologizes-after-rated-film-reportedly-airs-114601066", "Title": "Qantas Airways apologizes after R-rated film reportedly airs on every screen during flight", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 11:12 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- Qantas Airways has drawn up a stir after broadcasting a slightly-racy movie across an entire flight.

As a result, the crew chose one movie to play across all screens \u201cbased on the request from a number of passengers,\" the company said.\nQantas did not identify the movie by name, but several media outlets have reported that it was \u201cDaddio,\" an R-rated film that hit theaters earlier this year.\n\u201cDaddio\" follows a woman (Dakota Johnson) who takes a cab from JFK airport and strikes up an extended conversation with her driver (Sean Penn) on her way back home to Manhattan \u2014 as the two discuss anything from what it takes to be a New Yorker to relationships and infidelity, notably her current affair with a married man. The film carries an R rating for \u201clanguage throughout, sexual material and brief graphic nudity.\u201d\nSocial media posts from users who claim they were on the Qantas flight said they were uncomfortable by nudity and sexting featured in the film \u2014 particularly for families and children who were on board. Two users on Reddit said that it was also impossible for individual passengers to turn off the movie.\nAfter determining that the movie was not appropriate for all ages, the Qantas crew attempted to fix screens for travelers who did not want to watch it \u2014 but later found that this was not possible and changed course.\n\u201cThe movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience,\" a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAll screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\nThe spokesperson added that Qantas is \u201creviewing how the (inital) movie was selected.\u201d\nIn the days following the incident, the airline has taken some flack online \u2014 including from travel rivals. \n\u201cPlot twist: We let you choose your movies,\u201d Air New Zealand wrote in a reply to the news on social media platform X.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/after-years-finding-rock-roll-hall-fame-cold-114598917", "Title": "After years of finding the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame cold as ice, Foreigner now knows what love is", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 10:52 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- This month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame rectifies a wrong that many rock fans will celebrate with their lighters up in the air \u2014 the band Foreigner will finally be welcomed in.The English-American rockers \u2014 with hits like \u201cCold as Ice,\u201d \u201cHot Blooded\u201d and \u201cWaiting for a Girl Like You\" \u2014 topped the charts in the 1970s and \u201980s but never made it into the hall \u2014 much less a ballot \u2014 until last year, despite being eligible for more than 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a long wait and I know that we\u2019ve done enough in our career to warrant induction,\u201d says Al Greenwood, keyboardist and a founding member. \u201cI\u2019m not bitter about it. I mean, we\u2019re finally getting in and that\u2019s great.\u201d\nForeigner, led by singer Lou Gramm and guitarist Mick Jones, recorded nine Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including \u201c4,\u201d which spent 10 weeks in the top spot in 1981. \nForeigner were nominated for three Grammys and their songs have been heard on everything \u201cMiami Vice\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Tone-Loc sampled \u201cHot Blooded\u201d to create \u201cFunky Cold Medina.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t the best looking band in the world. We weren\u2019t the most dress-conscious band in the world. But Mick and Lou came up with some very, very strong songs and that\u2019s what\u2019s kept it going,\u201d bassist Rick Wills says. \u201cSixteen top 30 hits isn\u2019t too shabby.\u201d\nThe belated embrace by rock's establishment has a bittersweet taste, since original bassist Ed Gagliardi and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald have died and Jones has been sidelined by Parkinson\u2019s disease. The band will be inducted Oct. 19 in Cleveland.\nThe opening of the door for Foreigner coincided with a change in hall leadership in 2023 that led to key legacy acts getting invites, like Cher and Peter Frampton. Foreigner were among the top vote getters when the fans voted, nabbing almost 528,000 votes or 12.54%.\nThey'll join Mary J. Blige, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & the Gang, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Matthews Band, the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick, Alexis Korner, the late John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton in the class of '24.\n\u201cI think a lot of the talent that is in this class has been waiting on the outside as well as Foreigner,\u201d says Greenwood. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that I\u2019m in this class with such incredible talent.\u201d \nThe band got a public push from Jones\u2019 son-in-law Mark Ronson, who recruited musical friends such as Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Slash, Jack Black and the Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Chad Smith.\nForeigner in their heyday offered varied songs \u2014 the ballad \u201cI Want to Know What Love Is\u201d is very different from \u201cUrgent\u201d \u2014 but many have endured to become the backbone of classic rock playlists. A new line-up \u2014 dubbed Foreigner 2.0 \u2014 attract tens of thousands a night on tour. \nJones started the American-British band in 1976 in New York City, selecting each of its members, the first being Greenwood, who he'd never met. The keyboardist was invited to jam with Jones in a storage area of the band's manager's office. \nBut Greenwood soon grew disillusioned by the lack of progress over two weeks and decided to tell Jones he was going back to his own band.\n\u201cI\u2019m about to go up to Mick and Mick comes in and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got this song.\u2019 And he starts playing \u2018Feels Like the First Time\u2019 on guitar. And I go, \u2018Wow, I think we got something here,\u2019\" he says laughing. \"Thankfully, I did not leave.\u201d \nThe fledgling band's four-song demo \u2014 which included a raw version of \u201cFeels Like the First Time\u201d \u2014 was turned down by all the major record labels until music legend John Kalodner convinced Atlantic Records to reconsider.\nFour hit albums in five years \u2014 \u201cForeigner,\u201d \u201cDouble Vision,\u201d \u201cHead Games\u201d and \u201c4\u201d \u2014 cemented the band's place in classic rock history but not in the Rock Hall.

He was in New York and called Gramm because he heard Foreigner was looking for a new bassist. He was invited to their open auditions the next day. \nAfter Wills showed his chops on songs like \u201cDouble Vision\u201d and \u201cHot Blooded,\u201d drummer Dennis Elliott announced he wanted Willis in the band. There were some 70 bassists still waiting to audition.\nWillis urgently left to fly home to London to help care for his two young children, who were suffering from whooping cough and chickenpox, and woke up to a phone call that he was in the band.

He does not discuss scandals involving his co-star Danny Masterson, who was found guilty of two counts of rape in 2023 and is serving a 30-year prison sentence. Valderrama also steers clear of stories that made him the subject of tabloid fascination. This includes his high-profile relationships with actors Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan.\nWhen asked why he chose to opt out of mentioning his past relationships, Valderrama responded that his focus when writing this book was on the theme of service.\n\u201cThe book is about my family \u2014 my mother, and my father\u2019s story.

And with the deadline just months away, his original idea wasn\u2019t panning out.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere. I had nothing,\u201d he recalled in an interview.\nHappily, a friend introduced him to playwright David Henry Hwang, and they agreed to collaborate on a piece about a historical figure they both admired: Federico Garcia Lorca, the leftist Spanish dramatist and poet who was killed by fascist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War.\nOf necessity, the collaboration proceeded fast and furiously. \u201cI was so pressed for time that he started faxing me pages, one by one,\u201d Golijov said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how the thing was going to end or anything.\u201d Hwang wrote the libretto in English and Golijov translated it into Spanish.\nSomehow the result, \u201cAinadamar,\u201d premiered on schedule. It was restaged in revised form two years later at the Santa Fe Opera, and is now coming to the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Brazilian director and choreographer Deborah Colker that runs for nine performances beginning Oct. 15.\nThe title is an Arabic word that translates as \u201cfountain of tears\u201d and refers to a spring in the hills above the city of Granada \u2014 the site where Lorca was assassinated in 1936.\nHwang said he and Golijov were \u201cmoved by the fact that Lorca had to some extent predicted his own murder through his work.\u201d His early play, \u201cMariana Pineda\u201d tells of a Spanish heroine of the 19th century liberal movement who was executed for refusing to betray her comrades.\nMargarita Xirgu, who starred in that play, became Lorca\u2019s muse, and when she fled to Cuba she tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to join her.\nEarly on, Hwang decided to have Xirgu, rather than Lorca, be the main character in the opera.\n\u201cI liked the idea of creating Lorca through the memories of Margarita,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cI feel in general that when you\u2019re dealing with an iconic figure, it\u2019s interesting to see them refracted through the perceptions of those who had some sort of intimate relationship with them.\u201d\nAn unexpected wrinkle arose when Golijov realized that Tanglewood had already assembled a cast for the opera he didn\u2019t write \u2014 and it was all women.\n\u201cAnd there was one who had this extraordinary dark voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI got goosebumps. I told David, how about we make Lorca a woman.\u201d\nSo what many critics have seen as a nod to a time-honored operatic tradition of having a woman portray a young man in a \u201ctrousers role\u201d actually came about as a matter of necessity.\nAt the Met, the role of Lorca will be sung by mezzo Daniela Mack. Soprano Angel Blue is Margarita (with Gabriella Reyes substituting on Oct. 30.) Soprano Elena Villal\u00f3n portrays Margarita\u2019s protege Nuria, Flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada is the politician who arranged Lorca\u2019s execution, and the conductor is Miguel Harth-Bedoya. The 90-minute opera is performed without intermission.\nWhen the production premiered in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2022, Rowena Smith in The Guardian described Golijov\u2019s score as \u201ca collage of influences, shifting fluidly from Flamenco and electronic music to the classical language of 19th-century opera.\u201d\n\u201cIn this production the musical language finds a mirror in Deborah Colker\u2019s striking staging,\u201d she added.\nColker, who had never directed an opera, said she approached the staging as a choreographer, with singers and chorus members joining in the continual flow of dance rhythms. She enlisted a Flamenco choreographer, Antonio Najarro, to assist her.\n\u201cI want constant movement,\u201d Colker said. \u201cI want the audience not to recognize who is dancing, who is singing. Everybody is moving the sets, building the barricades, the tabletops where people dance in Spanish bars.\u201d\nGolijov himself said he found Colker\u2019s work revelatory.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen dozens of productions and this is the one that actually made me discover things in the piece that I hadn\u2019t discovered,\u201d he said. \u201cShe got the tectonic movements, the very slow geological movements that are in the structure of the opera, so when she creates a climax, it\u2019s 10 more times explosive because she knows how to build it.\u201d\nYuval Sharon, artistic director of the Detroit Opera, said that when his company staged the production, \u201cit set our audience on fire. They had never seen anything like it before.\u201d\nFor Golijov, having his opera performed at the Met is especially sweet given his troubled history with the company. He had been commissioned to compose a new piece for the 2018\u201319 season. But in 20016, the Met canceled the commission, citing the composer\u2019s lack of progress.\n\u201cI had a few years of bad depression,\u201d Golijov acknowledges. \u201cI wrote much less, and I think they got scared that I would never finish the opera.\u201d\nIn recent years, he has again become productive, composing a song cycle, \u201cFalling Out of Time,\u201d a violin concerto, and other pieces. He also wrote the score for Francis Ford\u2019s Coppola\u2019s new movie, \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s beginning work on a new opera, inspired by what he calls a lifelong fascination with Laika, the Soviet dog who became the first living creature to orbit the Earth.\nDoes he hope it also might eventually see a production at the Met?\nGolijov said that after the earlier disappointment, \u201cI think they love me, but they don\u2019t trust me.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/oprah-winfrey-selects-lisa-marie-presleys-posthumous-memoir-114590979", "Title": "Oprah Winfrey selects Lisa Marie Presley's posthumous memoir as her next book club selection", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 8:19 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- Oprah Winfrey has chosen Lisa Marie Presley's posthumous memoir as her new book club pick, and made a trip to the famed Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee, to meet with Presley's daughter and Elvis and Priscilla Presley's granddaughter, actor Riley Keough.Lisa Marie Presley's \u201cFrom Here to the Great Unknown,\" completed by Keough after Presley died unexpectedly in 2023, was published Tuesday.

Lawyers for WWE and Laurinaitis did not immediately return emails seeking comment late Monday. Emails to the WWE and its parent companies, Endeavor Group Holdings and its subsidiary, TKO Group Holdings, also were not returned immediately.\nMcMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. \nGrant, who worked in WWE\u2019s legal and talent departments from 2019 to 2022, sued the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis in January, making graphic allegations of sexual assault, harassment, trafficking and other physical and emotional abuse.\nMcMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant\u2019s lawsuit. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors TKO Group Holdings in January, a day after Grant filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cIf WWE and its parent company Endeavor are serious about parting ways with Vince McMahon and the toxic workplace culture he created, their executives should have no problem with releasing former WWE employees from their NDAs,\u201d Ann Callis, Grant\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first step to rehabilitating a company that covered up decades of sexual assault and human trafficking.\"\nMcMahon previously responded to Grant\u2019s lawsuit with a statement calling it \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/netflix-series-explores-womens-dreams-body-slamming-world-114586546", "Title": "Netflix series explores women's dreams in the body-slamming world of Japanese pro wrestling", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 1:38 AM", "content": "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman\u2019s road to empowerment and self-discovery \u2014 except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling.The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive.\nMatsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a \u201cheel,\u201d complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood.\n\u201cI gave it my all to be evil,\u201d Matsumoto said.\nA hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her.\n\u201cI still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAll the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.\u201d\n\u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series\u2019 dramatized wrestling scenes.\nJapanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S.\nThe actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the \u201cgiant swing,\u201d in which a wrestler grabs her opponent\u2019s legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the \u201cflying knee kick,\u201d which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne. \nThe trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly. \nOne key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again. \n\u201cDump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,\u201d said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series.\n\u201cPreviously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn\u2019t go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,\u201d she said.\nShe felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening to be hated, and I don\u2019t think anyone wants to be hated,\u201d Retriever said. \n\u201cWhen I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can\u2019t express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.\u201d\nThe series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans.\nSome viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series.\nRionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: \u201cThe actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.\"\nBut for most viewers, it\u2019s real enough and heartbreaking.\n\u201cThis is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,\u201d director Kazuya Shiraishi said.\n\u201cIt gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone\u2019s story.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/harris-introducing-sets-media-tour-people-voting-114585950", "Title": "Harris gets personal in media blitz, balks at breaking with Biden on policy", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:10 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- Kamala Harris wanted to help voters get to know her better with a cascade of media appearances on Tuesday, but the most lasting impression might have been her unwillingness to break with Joe Biden.Asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d how she would be different from the president she\u2019s served under for four years, Harris said \u201cwe\u2019re obviously two different people\u201d and \u201cI will bring those sensibilities to how I lead.\u201d\nHowever, she was not able to identify a decision where she would have gone another way. \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind,\u201d Harris said.\nThe exchange encapsulated Harris\u2019 struggle to portray herself as a candidate who can deliver the change voters crave while also remaining loyal to the current administration. Some Harris aides privately winced as gleeful Republicans swiftly circulated clips of her response and Donald Trump swiped at her in a social media post, calling it \u201cher dumbest answer so far.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until later in the show that Harris named something that she would do differently than Biden \u2014 she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.\nThe Democratic nominee said she would welcome contributions from the other party \u201cbecause I don\u2019t feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.\u201d\nThe interview was a reminder that friendly media venues \u2014 the women of \u201cThe View\u201d were nearly rapturous in their embrace of Harris \u2014 can be as treacherous for politicians to navigate as hardball journalistic interrogations. And it came at a delicate moment for Harris, whose motorcade whisked her from studio to studio in New York on Tuesday.\nEven though her abbreviated and unexpected campaign for the presidency is more than half over, Harris is still racing to introduce herself to voters who haven\u2019t made up their minds about her or whether to cast ballots in this year\u2019s election. After \u201cThe View,\u201d she spoke to radio host Howard Stern and planned to tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances came after Harris granted interviews to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday night, and Alex Cooper\u2019s podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d which was released Sunday. \nIt's a kaleidoscopic media blitz intended to reach key demographics, from men who are longtime fans of Stern to young women who follow Cooper's frank conversations about sex and relationships. \nHarris' decision to open up is a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, and it\u2019s an acknowledgment that she needs to do more to defeat Trump.\nGetting personal has never been easy for Harris, a lawyer by training whose first job in public life was making opening and closing arguments as a courtroom prosecutor.\n\u201cIt feels immodest to me to talk about myself,\u201d Harris said to Stern. \u201cA friend of mine actually said, \u2018look, this is not a time to worry about modesty, because obviously you gotta let people know who you are.\u2019\u201d\nBy the time she was finished with the interview, Harris had, by her standards, bared her soul. Some examples:\nShe ate a family sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton. She works out on an elliptical every day. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother\u2019s laboratory, and she got fired. Her favorite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, and she recommends going with a \u201cclear head,\u201d meaning not high on drugs, because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of visual stimulation.\u201d\nHarris also said \u201cI literally lose sleep\u201d over the election because \u201cthe stakes are so high.\u201d\nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe \u201call the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don\u2019t know anything about my life, I can\u2019t relate to them at all.\"\n\u201cThey want to like and trust you,\" she said. \nJennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cWe did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,\u201d she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that \u201dwill be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.\u201d\nHarris used her Tuesday appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d to discuss her proposal to have Medicare cover in-home care for the elderly, helping to relieve the burden faced by an increasing number of families.\n\u201cThere are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\" she said. \"They\u2019re taking care of their kids and taking care of their aging parents.\u201d\nShe spoke about taking care of her own mother when she was dying of cancer, including cooking for her and picking out soft clothing that wouldn't irritate her. And she criticized Trump as selfish and uninterested in helping Americans. If you watch his grievance-filled rallies, she said, \u201che does not talk about what your parents need, what your children need.\u201d\nInstead, Harris said, \u201che talks about his needs.\u201d\nIt was a moment that Harris' campaign would much rather get noticed than her answer about Biden. They believe that a small yet pivotal numbers of undecided voters want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.\nRepublican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.\n\u201cThis race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who\u2019s going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,\u201d he said. \nHarris' name recognition grew when she became vice president, but 1 out of 10 people still said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion, according to AP-NORC polling. Recent shifts in her favorability numbers suggest that views on Harris may still be somewhat malleable. \nOther polls have similar results. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her. \nNear the end of Harris' interview on the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast, Cooper confronted the vice president with one of the central questions of this campaign.\nSo many people, Cooper said, are \u201cfrustrated and just exhausted with politics in general,\" so \"why should we trust you?\u201d\nHarris answered by saying \u201cyou can look at my career to know what I care about.\u201d\n\u201cI care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,\" she said. \"I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/taylor-swift-back-watch-travis-kelce-chiefs-eras-114582465", "Title": "Taylor Swift is back to watch Travis Kelce and the Chiefs with Eras Tour soon to resume", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 7:47 PM", "content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Taylor Swift was back at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs play the New Orleans Saints after the pop superstar had missed the team's previous two games on the road.Swift is in the final days of a break from her record-setting Eras Tour, which resumes with the first of three shows Friday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

That includes the now-dismissed federal case accusing him of sexually exploiting minors and possessing child sexual abuse material, charges that stemmed from the same allegations that led to his arrest.\nChasing Horse still faces criminal charges in Canada, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, and in Las Vegas.\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\nIn the decades since starring in the Oscar-winning movie, authorities say he built a reputation as a self-proclaimed medicine man among tribes and traveled around North America to perform healing ceremonies.\nHe\u2019s accused of using that position to gain access to vulnerable girls and women starting in the early 2000s, leading a cult and taking underage wives.\nFederal prosecutors took no action in their case against Chasing Horse after filing the charges in February 2023, court records show. They moved to dismiss the case on Sept. 27 \u2014 a day after the Nevada high court ordered the dismissal of Chasing Horse's indictment in state court \u2014 but did not detail in court filings why they wanted to dismiss the case.\nBoth the state and federal cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can refile the charges. Federal prosecutor Steven Rose didn't immediately respond to an email Monday asking if the U.S. government intends to do so. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said his office will refile the charges in state court, which included sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.\nState prosecutors on Friday filed a new case in Las Vegas against Chasing Horse that accuses him of filming himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. He is being held in the custody of Las Vegas police on $200,000 bail.\nIn at least one video, the girl was \u201cfully passed out,\" prosecutor William Rowles said Monday in court.\nRowles said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, were found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.\nHis defense attorney, Kristy Holston, declined to comment on the new case or the dismissal of the federal charges. Rowles also said he had no comment.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court in late September sided with Chasing Horse, after his attorney successfully argued that a definition of grooming \u2014 presented to the grand jury without expert testimony \u2014 had tainted the state's case, and that prosecutors should have shared with the grand jury inconsistent statements made by one of the victims.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-armorer-alec-baldwins-film-rust-pleads-guilty-114579613", "Title": "Movie armorer on Alec Baldwin's film 'Rust' pleads guilty to gun charge in separate case", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 6:02 PM", "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The weapons supervisor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film \u201cRust\" pleaded guilty Monday to a separate criminal charge of carrying a gun into a licensed liquor establishment.Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed agreed to change her plea to guilty on the charge in exchange for a reduced sentence of 18 months supervised probation. \nJudge T. Glenn Ellington approved the agreement that allows Gutierrez-Reed to begin probation while serving out an 18-month prison term at a New Mexico state penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\nIn the \u201cRust\u201d case, prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the movie set and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.\nGutierrez-Reed shuffled into the Santa Fe courtroom Monday in a beige jumpsuit, handcuffs and ankle shackles to change her plea to guilty and waive her right to trial.\n\u201cI'd just like to apologize to the court and thank you for your judgment today,\u201d she said.\nThe case stems from evidence that a few weeks before \u201cRust\u201d began filming in October 2021, Gutierrez-Reed carried a gun into a downtown bar in Santa Fe where firearms are prohibited. \nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey said Gutierrez-Reed filmed herself in the bathroom of the bar with a handgun \u2014 explaining how she snuck in the prohibited firearm in a video that was obtained when authorities searched the armorer's phone during the \u201cRust\u201d investigation.\nGutierrez-Reed was convicted in March at trial of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Hutchins.

Morrissey has since asked the judge to reconsider.\nUnder terms of her plea agreement, Gutierrez-Reed is prohibited while on probation from possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or drugs and must pay $180 in fees while submitting a sample of her DNA to a criminal database and completing an addiction treatment program.\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles said the agreement makes it possible for Gutierrez-Reed to be released from prison as soon as June 2025 to complete probation in Arizona without getting an additional felony conviction on her record.\nBefore being led away, Gutierrez-Reed blew kisses toward the court gallery where her mother, Stacy Reed, was seated.\nReed said she was grateful her daughter can begin to fulfill new parole requirements prior to release from prison.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/lore-segal-esteemed-austrian-american-writer-fled-nazis-114579039", "Title": "Lore Segal, esteemed Austrian American writer who fled the Nazis as a child, dies at 96", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 5:56 PM", "content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lore Segal, an esteemed Viennese American author and translator whose gift for words helped her family escape from the Nazis and who later drew upon her experiences as a Jewish refugee and immigrant for such fiction as \u201cOther People's Houses\u201d and \u201cHer First American,\u201d died Monday at 96.Segal, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, died in her apartment after a brief illness, her publisher Melville House said in a statement.\nAfter settling in the U.S. in 1951, Segal wrote novels, short stories, essays and children's books and translated the Bible and Grimms' fairy tales, which featured illustrations by her friend Maurice Sendak. Her life \u2014 filtered through memory and imagination \u2014 was her greatest muse. \u201cOther People's Houses,\u201d released in 1964 and originally serialized in the New Yorker, closely followed her childhood in Austria, her years in foster care in London during World War II and her arrival in New York, where the growing familiarity with the city\u2019s sights and sounds \u2014 \u201ccharged thus upon the air\u201d \u2014 makes the \u201calien into a citizen.\u201d\n\u201cHer First American\u201d continued her early experiences in the U.S., while \u201cLucinella\u201d was a comic novella inspired by her time in the 1970s at the Yaddo artist retreat in upstate New York. Segal, who taught at Columbia University, Princeton University and several other schools, satirized academic life in \u201cShakespeare's Kitchen.\u201d\nIn 2019, she compiled her fiction and nonfiction in the anthology \u201cThe Journal I Did Not Keep,\u201d in which she summarized the importance and imperfection of recapturing the past.\n\u201cI believe that the act of remembering and telling the story of what we remember will always be to some extent fatal to the thing remembered,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo what really happened?\u201d\nHer many admirers included such author-critics as Cynthia Ozick, Vivian Gornick and Alfred Kazin. In 2008, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Kitchen.\u201d The American Academy of Arts and Letters inducted her in 2023.\nGornick would cite her \u201cironic intelligence\" and \u201cgift for detachment.\u201d In her fiction, Segal set a tone that was even, objective and occasionally cutting, like her description of an artist in \u201cLucinella\u201d who \u201ctends to mumble her words inside her mouth, so as to keep the option of eating them.\u201d She could also be intimate and familiar, with such recurring characters as her alter ego Ilka, a Viennese refugee; and Carter Bayoux, a Black intellectual with whom Ilka has an affair in \u201cHer First American.\u201d\nHer narratives were often sustained through passages of overheard conversation, whether at a literary cocktail party in Harlem or a gathering of faculty members in Connecticut. Several stories in her 2023 collection \u201cLadies' Lunch\u201d were structured around the midday meals of friends in advanced old age who share memories, regrets, fears and everyday concerns.\n\u201cI like writing dialogue,\u201d she told the online publication The Millions in 2019. \u201cI like it better than explaining. I\u2019d rather have a character develop and express him or herself through dialogue than explaining what they\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s a preference. I like how we discover and uncover ourselves through dialogue. I tell my students, you see any two people together, walk behind them, listen, get the tone of their voice.\u201d\nBesides her books, Segal wrote for The New York Times, The New Republic, the Forward and other publications. The children's story \u201cWhen Mole Lost His Glasses,\u201d with drawings by Sergio Ruzzier, was adapted into an educational video featuring Spike Lee and then-New York Knick Stephon Marbury.\nSegal married the literary editor David Segal in 1961 and had two children. Her husband died of a heart attack in 1970.\nShe was born Lore Groszmann in Vienna in 1928, and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood until the Nazis annexed the country a decade later and antisemitism drove her family to ship her off on the Kindertransport to London, a time Segal and her mother would discuss in Mark Jonathan Harris\u2019 Academy Award-winning documentary \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers.\u201d\nSeparation somehow empowered her. Inquisitive and often impulsive, she wrote so many letters to British authorities that they granted her parents the rare privilege of letting them join her in London, where they worked as domestic servants. Lore stayed with a series of families, including one whose incomprehension of her past inspired her first real storytelling.\n\u201cIt seemed to me they had no idea of what it was like to live in Vienna under Hitler,\u201d Segal told The Associated Press in 2011. \u201cThey were asking me questions that didn\u2019t seem to be relevant. They had some profound lack of information. So I got hold of one of those little exercise books, homework books. I filled the 36 pages in German with the story, which is essentially the story of \u2018Other People\u2019s Houses.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the war, Segal graduated from the University of London\u2019s Bedford College and lived briefly in the Dominican Republic \u2014 where other family members had settled \u2014 until allowed in the United States. Before becoming a writer, she discovered the various careers she was not meant for: She was a \u201cbad file clerk,\u201d a \u201cbad secretary\u201d and \u201cpretty bad textile designer.\"\nWriting, at first, also didn't seem to work because she believed she had nothing to say. She had never been in love and thought \u201cno big things\u201d had happened to her, not even during the war. Her breakthrough came in a class at the New School for Social Research in New York.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/federal-judge-orders-google-open-android-app-store-114574993", "Title": "Federal judge orders Google to open its Android app store to competition", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 4:26 PM", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire. The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cissy-houston-whitney-houstons-mother-grammy-winning-singer-114570980", "Title": "Cissy Houston, Whitney Houston's mother and Grammy-winning singer, dies at 91", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:56 PM", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- Cissy Houston, a two-time Grammy-winning soul and gospel artist who sang with Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and other stars and knew triumph and heartbreak as the mother of Whitney Houston, has died.

The acclaimed gospel singer was surrounded by her family.\n\u201cOur hearts are filled with pain and sadness. We loss the matriarch of our family,\u201d Pat Houston said in a statement. She said her mother-in-law's contributions to popular music and culture are \"unparalleled.\" \n\u201cMother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.\u201d\nA church performer from an early age, Houston was part of a family gospel act before breaking through in popular music in the 1960s as a member of the prominent backing group The Sweet Inspirations with Doris Troy and her niece Dee Dee Warwick. The group sang backup for a variety of soul singers including Otis Redding, Lou Rawls and The Drifters. They also sang backup for Dionne Warwick.\nHouston's many credits included Franklin\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201d(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u201d Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and Dusty Springfield\u2019s \u201cSon of a Preacher Man.\u201d The Sweet Inspirations also sang on stage with Presley, whom Houston would remember fondly for singing gospel during rehearsal breaks and telling her that she was \u201csquirrelly.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of our engagement with him, he gave me a bracelet inscribed with my name on the outside,\u201d she wrote in her memoir \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d published in 1998. \u201cOn the inside of the bracelet he had inscribed his nickname for me: Squirrelly.\u201d\nThe Sweet Inspirations had their own top 20 single with the soul-rock \u201cSweet Inspiration,\u201d made in the Memphis studio where Franklin and Springfield among others recorded hits and released four albums just in the late \u201960s. The group appeared on Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and sang background vocals for The Jimi Hendrix Experience on the song \u201cBurning of the Midnight Lamp\u201d in 1967.\nHouston\u2019s last performance with The Sweet Inspirations came after the group hit the stage with Presley in a Las Vegas show in 1969. Her final recording session with the group turned into their biggest R&B hit \u201c(Gotta Find) A Brand New Lover\u201d a composition by the production team of Gamble & Huff, who appeared on the group\u2019s fifth album, \u201cSweet Sweet Soul.\u201d\nDuring that time, the group occasionally performed live concert dates with Franklin. After the group\u2019s success and four albums together, Houston left The Sweet Inspirations to pursue a solo career where she flourished.\nHouston became an in-demand session singer and recorded more than 600 songs in multiple genres throughout her career. Her vocals can be heard on tracks alongside a wide range of artists including Chaka Khan, Donny Hathaway, Jimi Hendrix, Luther Vandross, Beyonc\u00e9, Paul Simon, Roberta Flack and Whitney Houston.\nCissy Houston went on to complete several records, including \u201cPresenting Cissy Houston,\u201d the disco-era \u201cThink It Over\u201d and the Grammy-winning gospel albums \u201cFace to Face\u201d and \u201cHe Leadeth Me.\u201d \nIn 1971, Houston\u2019s signature vocals were featured on Burt Bacharach\u2019s solo album, which includes \u201cMexican Divorce,\u201d \u201cAll Kinds of People\u201d and \u201cOne Less Bell to Answer.\u201d She performed various standards including Barbra Streisand\u2019s hit song, \u201cEvergreen.\u201d\nNever far from her native New Jersey or musical origins, Houston presided for decades over the 200-member Youth Inspirational Choir at Newark\u2019s New Hope Baptist Church, where Whitney Houston sang as a child. \nCissy Houston would say that she had discouraged her daughter from show business, but they were joined in music for much of Whitney\u2019s life, from church to stage performances to television and film and the recording studio. Whitney\u2019s rise seemed inevitable, not only because of her obvious talents, but because of her background: Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick were cousins, Leontyne Price a cousin once removed, Franklin a close family friend.\nWhitney Houston made her debut on national television when she and Cissy Houston sang a medley of Franklin hits on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show.\u201d Cissy Houston sang backup on Whitney\u2019s eponymous, multi-platinum first album, and the two shared the lead on \u201cI Know Him So Well,\u201d from the 1987 mega-seller \u201cWhitney.\u201d\nThey would sing together often in concert and appeared in the 1996 film \u201cThe Preacher\u2019s Wife.\u201d Their most indelible moments likely came from the video for one of Whitney\u2019s biggest hits from the mid-1980s, \u201cGreatest Love of All.\" It was filmed as a mother-daughter homage, ending with a joyous Whitney exiting the stage of Harlem\u2019s Apollo Theater and embracing Cissy Houston, who stood in the wings.\nOn Feb. 11, 2012, Whitney Houston was found dead \u2014 from what was ruled as an accidental drowning \u2014 in a Beverly Hills bathtub. Cissy Houston would write about her daughter in the memoir \u201cRemembering Whitney: A Mother\u2019s Story of Life, Loss and The Night The Music Stopped.\u201d \nIn 2015, Cissy Houston was grieving again when granddaughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, the only child of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, was found unconscious in a bathtub, spent months in a coma and died at age 22. The family was back in the news in 2018 with the release of the documentary \u201cWhitney.\u201d which included allegations that Dee Dee Warwick (who died in 2008) had molested Whitney when she was a girl.\nCissy Houston was briefly married to Freddie Garland in the 1950s; their son, Gary Garland, was a guard for the Denver Nuggets and later sang on many of Whitney Houston\u2019s tours. Cissy Houston was married to Whitney\u2019s father, entertainment executive John Russell Houston, from 1959-1990. In addition to Whitney, the Houstons also had a son, Michael.\nCissy Houston was born Emily Drinkard in Newark, the youngest of eight children of a factory worker and a housewife. She was just 5 when she and three siblings founded the Drinkard Singers, a gospel group that lasted 30 years, performing on the same bill as Mahalia Jackson among others and releasing the 1959 album \u201cA Joyful Noise.\u201d\nShe later said she would have been happy to remain in gospel, but John Houston encouraged her to take on studio work. When rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins (along with drummer Levon Helm and other future members of The Band) needed an extra voice, Cissy Houston stepped in.\n\u201cI wanted to get my work done, and get it done quickly. I was there, but I didn\u2019t have to be part of them. I was in the world, but I wasn\u2019t of the world, as St. Paul put it,\u201d Houston wrote in \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d remembering how she soon began working with the Drifters and other singers.\n\u201cAt least in the recording studio we were living together as God intended us to. Some days, we spent 12 or 15 hours together there,\" she wrote. \"The skin-deep barriers of race seemed to fall away as we toiled side by side creating our little pop masterpieces.\u201d\nPat Houston said she is thankful for the many valuable lessons learned from her mother-in-law. She said the family feels \u201cblessed and grateful\" that God allowed Cissy to spend so many years. \n\u201cWe are touched by your generous support, and your outpouring of love during our profound time of grief,\u201d Houston said on behalf of the family. \u201cWe respectfully request our privacy during this difficult time.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cissy-houston-grammy-winner-mother-whitney-houston-dies-114570705", "Title": "Cissy Houston, Grammy winner and mother of Whitney Houston, dies at 91", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:49 PM", "content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/billie-jean-king-named-grand-marshal-136th-rose-114570367", "Title": "Billie Jean King named grand marshal for the 136th Rose Parade on Jan. 1", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:26 PM", "content": "PASADENA, Calif. -- Tennis great Billie Jean King will preside over the 136th Rose Parade as grand marshal next year.King, who turns 81 next month, was introduced Monday in a shower of confetti on the lawn of Tournament House as \u201cPhiladelphia Freedom,\u201d the hit song Elton John wrote for her, blared.\n\u201cI'm still kicking,\u201d she said, smiling.\nKing will ride the 5 1/2-mile route through the streets of Pasadena on Jan. 1 and be part of the coin flip for the 111th Rose Bowl football game later that day.\n\u201cWe looked forward to it every year,\u201d she said, recalling her childhood in Long Beach. \u201cMy mother and I always loved parades.\"\nThe parade\u2019s theme of \u201cBest Day Ever!\u201d celebrates life\u2019s best moments.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a whole new saying the rest of my life now.

So when Garfield recently went on a six-day retreat in the woods without his phone, one of his first texts was to his co-star.\u201cI came out and I sent Florence a message. I just felt compelled,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cWhen you reconnect with yourself, you reconnect with a bunch of stuff that matters to you. And I was just like, man, I haven\u2019t let Florence know for a few months how much this film and this time with her meant to me.\u201d\n\u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d directed by John Crowley ( \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d) and penned by playwright Nick Payne, is the kind of movie that provokes an emotional response, including for its two stars. In playing their characters, Almut and Tobias, across a decade of time, \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d poignantly condenses, and remixes into a non-linear narrative, a wide spectrum of life. Right alongside each other are sex and heartbreak, stolen moments and life-changing ones, birth and death.\nIt was enough to go through together as actors that Pugh and Garfield, when they spoke the morning of the film\u2019s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, were still mourning it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had this happen before in this way. We\u2019ve literally spent the last two days trying to unpack it and everybody wants us to unpack it. And we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cWhen we finished the movie, every scene that got closer and closer to the end, it became harder and harder to process that we weren\u2019t going to be able to do it anymore.\u201d\nAs two of the most in-demand actors of their generation, Pugh, 28, and Garfield, 41, have transformed themselves into all kinds of roles. They have donned Marvel costumes and joined period ensembles. Pugh was memorably outfitted in an elaborate flower dress for \u201cMidsommar.\u201d But \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d which A24 opens in theaters Friday, is a particularly unadorned view of two of the best actors working. It\u2019s the first film in which Garfield has used his real voice.\n\u201cThey\u2019re two very beautiful creatures to look at, and have looked fantastically beautiful on screen \u2014 and do look very beautiful in this, by the way, just not in a glammed-up, aspirational fashion,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThey\u2019re also both British actors who have made significant inroads in American cinema, and to some eyes, people might only know them from that. To have them speak in their own accents allowed those roles to fall back much closer to them.\u201d\nChemistry can be a tricky thing to pin down. Crowley, whose 2007 film \u201cBoy A\u201d was Garfield\u2019s feature film debut, cast Garfield first. After that came Pugh. Crowley prefers to keep dress rehearsals subdued in order to save the energy for shooting. But there were, he says, \u201cflickers of something very special\" between them.\n\u201cMuch like two championship tennis players warming up, they couldn\u2019t not once in a while hit the ball in an extraordinary way and have the other person hit it back,\" says Crowley.\nIn an interview together, the connection between Garfield and Pugh was abundantly clear. Their reaction to the meme that sprung from the movie's first image (in which a carousel horse appeared to be their uninvited co-star), was, itself, a viral video that hinted at their natural comic patter. But whatever chemistry is, Garfield is more inclined to attribute it to staying present as actors.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t predict it. I knew Florence was a magnificent actor. But that\u2019s all I knew. I didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d work together well. Neither of us did,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cBut for me, honestly, it exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s an incomparable thing. There\u2019s no way of comparing my experience with Florence with any other experience I\u2019ve had.\n\u201cI said this to Florence last night, I was like, \u2018It\u2019s weirdly, in a way, one performance. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stitched together.\u2019\u201d\nFor Pugh, chemistry is about showing up with the right intentions.\n\u201cWe were willing and wanting to do that for each other,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of times when you\u2019re willing to do it and someone isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s also fine because you can also create your own chemistry with yourself, I suppose.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so much more hard work and much less fun,\u201d adds Garfield, smiling. \u201cJust like self-pleasure.\u201d\nIn some ways, Garfield and Pugh were living alongside \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d and experiencing some of its chapters of life with their characters, albeit from different perspectives. When Almut is diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she is forced to make difficult decisions that weigh having children with her ambition as a chef.\n\u201cIf you want to be successful, if you want to actually give your career a good crack at it, you\u2019re going to be running through the time that is most optimum for having children,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff that I\u2019m now having to figure out since we made the movie, since the movie\u2019s coming out. It\u2019s for all ages of women that are trying to navigate this unbelievably tricky dilemma.\u201d\nSome of the challenges faced by Almut and Tobias were deeply familiar to the actors. Garfield\u2019s mother died of cancer in 2019. Others took more imagination. Neither Garfield or Pugh have children, but a lengthy birth scene, in a gas station bathroom, is the movie\u2019s most show-stopping moment. To experience Almut\u2019s cancer treatment, Pugh was convinced she needed to cut her hair. Crowley filmed Garfield cutting Pugh's hair for the scene. \n\u201cI wanted this to be gone now so I knew how she feels in these scenes that I\u2019ve read in the script and thought about, but that I can\u2019t imagine how she felt yet,\u201d Pugh says, pointing at her hair. \u201cI loved that day. It was a very powerful day.\u201d\nThe experience has left both actors trying to hold onto something from \u201cWe Live in Time.\u201d Garfield began the interview by opening up a book, offering a poem and then reading aloud Kabir\u2019s \u201cTo Be a Slave of Intensity.\u201d\n\u201cJust to remind myself that I\u2019m a person, I guess,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd because this film is about being as vitality alive as humanly possible. I think it\u2019s really hard to remember how to do that sometimes \u2014 a lot of the time. In fact, it\u2019s all set up against us doing it. So we need practices to keep us in touch with that.\u201d\nIf \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d is ultimately about making peace with the fleeting nature of all that\u2019s precious, and trying to appreciate those moments when they\u2019re happening, Garfield is doing his best to carry on that mentality and be grateful for the time he and Pugh had together.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/top-20-global-concert-tours-pollstar-114569524", "Title": "Top 20 Global Concert Tours from Pollstar", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:00 PM", "content": "The Top 20 Global Concert Tours ranks artists by average box office gross per city and includes the average ticket price for shows Worldwide.

At first he\u2019s a millennial kid, then a college guy as the Twin Towers fall on 9/11.In time George \u2014 he\u2019s given no surname \u2014 graduates and struggles over what to do with the rest of his life. Fate actually treats him pretty well. He\u2019s an attractive, smart New Yorker; his family has some money; and he\u2019s often quite lucky.\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know it from his clownish, sour, perplexed, defeatist attitude. He\u2019s self-absorbed and self-disparaging, lovable and devilish \u2014 the list could go on.\nThe novel\u2019s author, Kate Greathead, is a gifted storyteller who reels off dialogue filled with wit and humor so well it makes page-turning a pleasure and \u201cThe Book of George\u201d an easy read.\nBut just as the indecisive George doesn\u2019t know where he is going in life, the reader doesn\u2019t know where his story is going either. Getting there, in a way, is the point.\nGeorge groans inwardly at the vacuous \u201csitcom-level banter\u201d that comes easily to him in conversation. Greathead is deft at dishing out such dialogue, too, and chapter after chapter, as George ages and a variety of crises large and small arise, this episodic novel seems a form of first-rate TV sitcom between covers.\nGeorge would be glad to call it \u201cthe show about nothing,\u201d similar to \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Then he would cancel it.\nChoosing philosophy as his college major, George writes his thesis on Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th-century philosopher often seen as deeply pessimistic, much like George himself. Greathead, in the book\u2019s epigraph, quotes from an 1807 letter written by Johanna Schopenhauer to her 19-year-old son, Arthur, whom she says could be \u201ca credit to human society\u201d but is nevertheless \u201cirritating and unbearable.\u201d\nGeorge\u2019s own mother, Ellen, couldn\u2019t have said it better.\nAfter graduating, George eventually decides to become a writer. He starts a novel, but agonizes over the point of it. Early on, George says the book is \u201cabout a boy who grows up to be a man who is disappointed by life.\u201d The book shifts gears over time. It\u2019s title, finally, is \u201cAll For Naught.\u201d\nGeorge may be a doom-and-gloom sort, but that\u2019s not the case for Greathead\u2019s novel. Page after page, her writing is full of humor built around prickly sarcasm and woebegone twists in George\u2019s life.\nThere are serious, even sad, moments, plus plot turns that give the narrative depth. The reader may begin to feel an emotional tug. Jenny, a young woman who falls in love with George, lives with him for long, often agonizing stretches. They hit midlife as the pandemic hits the country, and Jenny brings real poignancy to the story.\nShe even grasps, finally, what George is all about.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/book-review-paula-hawkins-returns-psychological-thriller-blue-114565592", "Title": "Book Review: Paula Hawkins returns with psychological thriller \u2019The Blue Hour'", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:38 AM", "content": "Since bursting on the scene in 2015 with \u201cThe Girl on a Train,\u201d Paula Hawkins has established herself as a reliable writer of psychological thrillers set in the U.K. \u201cThe Blue Hour\u201d doesn\u2019t plow any new ground on that front, but it\u2019s a tight story with interesting characters that keeps you engaged until the end.Set mostly on an isolated Scottish island named Eris, where a famous painter and ceramicist named Vanessa Chapman once lived and worked, the story begins with a discovery. A bone in one of Chapman\u2019s sculptures, now owned by an estate, may be human. That revelation links together the three main characters \u2014 Chapman\u2019s longtime companion Grace Winters, a Chapman scholar who works for Fairburn Estate named James Becker, and Julian, Chapman\u2019s ex-husband who went missing 20 years ago. \nTold in the present, in flashbacks from two decades ago, and via excerpts from Chapman\u2019s diary, the plot moves along steadily. It\u2019s not really a keep-the-reader-guessing type of thriller, but more of a slow build that culminates in a shocking ending.\nHawkins weaves artistic themes and the creative process through the novel. Chapman\u2019s diary entries are filled with references to the landscape that inspires her \u2014 the \u201cterrible chaos\u201d of waves, the sky \u201cmiraculous azure or threatening gunmetal.\u201d The title refers to a time at dusk before the stars come out when the color leaches from the day but it\u2019s not yet full dark. Hawkins\u2019 prose often mirrors Chapman\u2019s artistic eye. Here\u2019s Becker\u2019s first glimpse of Grace: \u201cHer face is soft, cheeks relaxing gently into jowls, and her colors are muddied: from her bowl of hair to her slightly protuberant eyes\u2026 she is painted in varying shades of brown.\u201d\nThe novel\u2019s setting is a character unto itself. Eris is reachable from the mainland only when the tide is out, in two six-hour chunks each day, and so it\u2019s a fine place to bury secrets \u2014 physical and psychological. Learning those secrets is the fun of the novel, and there are few authors writing today who drip them out, page by excruciating page, like Hawkins.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-review-piece-piece-odd-lego-doc-pharrell-114564922", "Title": "Movie Review: 'Piece by Piece,' a very odd Lego doc about Pharrell Williams snaps together somehow", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:15 AM", "content": "A movie documentary that uses only Lego pieces might seem an unconventional choice. When that documentary is about renowned musician-producer Pharrell Williams, it's actually sort of on-brand.\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d is a bright, clever song-filled biopic that pretends it's a behind-the-scenes documentary using small plastic bricks, angles and curves to celebrate an artist known for his quirky soul. It is deep and surreal and often adorable. Is it high concept or low? Like Williams, it's a bit of both.\nDirector Morgan Neville \u2014 who has gotten more and more experimental exploring other celebrity lives like Fred Rogers in \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?,\u201d\u201cRoadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain\u201d and \u201cSteve! (Martin): A Documentary in Two Pieces\u201d \u2014 this time uses real interviews but masks them under little Lego figurines with animated faces. Call this one a documentary in a million pieces.\nThe filmmakers try to explain their device \u2014 \u201cWhat if nothing is real? What if life is like a Lego set?\u201d Williams says at the beginning \u2014 but it's very tenuous. Just submit and enjoy the ride of a poor kid from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who rose to dominate music and become a creative director at Louis Vuitton.\nWilliams, by his own admission, is a little detached, a little odd. Music triggers colors in his brain \u2014 he has synesthesia, beautifully portrayed here \u2014 and it's his forward-looking musical brain that will make him a star, first as part of the producing team The Neptunes and then as an in-demand solo producer and songwriter.\nThere are highs and lows and then highs again. A verse Williams wrote for \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-N-Effect when he was making a living selling beats would lead to superstars demanding to work with him and partner Chad Hugo \u2014 Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Gwen Stefani, Missy Elliott and Jay-Z. All those superstars sit for interviews and have hysterically been depicted as Lego minifigures, right down to No Doubt's Adrian Young's mohawk. (Take my money, Lego.)\nWe also learn something about his wife, Helen, and his anguish over being a solo artist, an opportunity he spurned when it was his for the taking. Ultimately, we learn to understand his futuristic approach to fashion and music. \u201cWhat I am is a maverick,\u201d he says. No one will question him on that. \nThe 3D world the filmmakers have made is astonishing, with waves of clear Lego pieces washing up on a beach made of slats of Lego baseplates and Williams' collection of cool beats depicted as bouncing bricks with lights in them. There's Lego McDonald's nuggets, Lego pretzels, singing Lego fish and a Lego Anna Wintour, chilly and haughty in plastic, too.\nLego, while seemingly a restrictive medium \u2014 the hands are clips and everyone's walking is robotic since there are no Lego knees \u2014 can also, apparently, in the right hands soar, and here they do, with Williams in one gorgeous dream sequence watching the Earth's lights as an distant astronaut. It is when the filmmakers make Lego appear as water and music that are their crowning achievements. (Special kudos to the team that made Lego champagne bubbles.)\nMusic credits are notoriously hard to pin down \u2014 Williams claims to have created McDonald's notoriously mysterious jingle \u201cI'm lovin' it\u201d \u2014 and the filmmakers try to cover any misinformation with a simple disclaimer in the end credits: \u201cNot everything in this film is 100% accurate. For example, Pharrell never went to space.\u201d\nThere are also some extraordinary moments that snap by but likely took months to make, like a Lego glimpse of the \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lincoln Memorial and protest footage from Black Lives Matter figurines shouting \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d\nThe documentary lags a little during Williams' way up and rushes the years on top, although recreations of some of the music videos he fueled are too funny. Why he and Hugo broke up is papered over and the filmmakers struggle to find an ending, making several stutter steps.\n\u201cI think we're done,\u201d are the last words we hear as the filmmakers finally give up. But they've left behind a trippy, sweet portrait of a genius, forever in building blocks.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/guster-avett-brothers-florence-welch-helping-bring-alt-114564923", "Title": "Guster, Avett Brothers and Florence Welch are helping bring alt-rock to the musical theater stage", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:10 AM", "content": "NEW YORK -- Ryan Miller, lead singer of alternative rock band Guster, has a new gig that even he's a little surprised about: Musical theater songwriter. He laughs that he's gone all Broadway.\u201cI just went full-into the ballpit \u2014 just, like, face-first, take-me-wherever-this-is-going,\u201d he said before a recent rehearsal of his bright new musical \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d at Brooklyn Academy of Music.\nMiller is part of a growing trend of alt-rockers bringing a new sound to the space carved out by giants like Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber. \nThe Avett Brothers are about to have \u201cSwept Away\u201d land on Broadway, Florence + The Machine frontwoman Florence Welch is working on a musical about \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and Jack Antonoff is scoring \u201cRomeo & Juliet.\" Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke is laboring on \u201cHamlet Hail to the Thief,\u201d a mashup of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d and his band\u2019s music.\nArcade Fire\u2019s Will Butler is fresh off the success of the Tony-winning play \u201cStereophonic,\u201d Sufjan Stevens songs found a place on Broadway last season with \u201cIllinoise\u201d and the folk-rock band Jamestown Revival is fueling the reigning best new musical, \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be a wave and we\u2019re kind of catching it at a good time,\u201d says Miller. \u201cIt felt like there was already some soil that was being laid that I wouldn\u2019t have to break down.\u201d\nTony Award-winning producer John Johnson, who is helping create that wave by backing the musicals \u201cSwept Away,\u201d \u201cStereophonic\u201d and \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed,\u201d says the change reflects the rise of tastes of Millennials and Gen-X.\nIf, before the pandemic, the standard theatergoer was a suburban woman in her 60s, she's being replaced by folks in their 30s to 50s from chic neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as bedroom communities in New Jersey like Maplewood and South Orange.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of following the path of the generational shift in the audience that\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Johnson says, adding that these new theater-goers \u201care open to new stories, new voices, as well as the voices that they grew up with.\u201d\nAlt-rock has been heard on Broadway before, of course, with shows like Duncan Sheik's \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d and Alanis Morissette's \u201cJagged Little Pill,\u201d but rare is a cluster like theater is enjoying now.\nScott Avett, lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist for the Avett Brothers, has watched as his 2004 album \u201cMignonette\u201d \u2014 based on a book about men adrift for days in the middle of the ocean \u2014 finds a new life on stage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surreal, for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cThe blooming of the story with the songs and the concept has been very surreal,\u201d adding: \u201cIt feels like quite flattering and affirming.\u201d\nThe songs have been wedded to a story by John Logan and the Avetts wrote one song specifically for the show, \u201cLord Lay Your Hand On My Shoulder.\u201d\nThe leap to Broadway, in one way, isn't that strange for the Americana band, who have always written narrative-driven and character-based songs.\n\u201cShow tunes are like the longing coming from somebody that then is exaggerated to the stage,\u201d says Avett. \u201cWe grew up projecting that from a smaller place.\u201d\nIf \u201cSwept Away\u201d began as a book that became an album, \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d started life as a 2012 sci-fi comedy starring Aubrey Plaza, who played one of a trio of journalists hunting whoever placed an intriguing classified ad: \u201cWanted: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke,\u201d it reads. \u201cMust bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed.\u201d\nAside from the time-travel silliness, the film and musical is about the fading dreams of aspiring professionals in their 20s and 30s who see diminished opportunities and want to go back to the comfort of the past.\nMiller initially had no intentions of making musical theater. When not touring with his four-piece band, he scores films, appears on podcasts and even starred in his own PBS series. Broadway or Broadway-adjacent didn't appeal.\nMiller, who lives in Vermont, was simply turned off by the sheer amount of time it usually took: Fellow Vermont creators Ana\u00efs Mitchell's \u201cHadestown\u201d took 14 years and Trey Anastasio's \u201cHands on a Hardbody\u201d took 10 years and closed after less than a month.\nBut Miller found himself gradually sucked in and enjoying a timeline that was accelerated. He was originally asked just to attend a workshop performance of \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d studded with Guster songs \u2014 basically, a Guster jukebox \u2014 and loved it. \u201cHave I just been like a closeted theater kid my whole life?\u201d he asked himself.\nSoon he was writing original songs for it. He was a natural, since he had scored the film, knew the characters and the emotional beats. He wrote five new stage songs in a month and sent them to book writer Nick Blaemire.\n\u201cI remember after I finished that fifth song, I sent it to Nick, I was like, \u2018Man, really fell in love with this.' Like something happened and I\u2019m going to be really bummed if I don\u2019t get to just see it once.'\u201d\nMiller then went on a writing tear, offering some 15 new songs in place of the Guster ones. \u201cThis was the rule: I was like, \u2018Just let me beat it. If I don\u2019t beat it, we\u2019ll all know and that\u2019s it.\u2019\"\nOne new song \u2014 \u201cI Wanna Go Back\u201d \u2014 shows Miller clearly having fun, with the lyrics: \"We're losing our hair/It doesn't seem fair/All the best of our days are behind us and gone/Xbox/cheap buzz/tan lines/peach fuzz.\u201d \nOnly three Guster songs \u2014 including \u201cOne Man Wrecking Machine\u201d \u2014 made the cut. The rest are from Miller, who relished the storytellers' task of creating songs specifically tailored for the characters and moments. \n\"It\u2019s been like, one of the greatest thrills, I think, of my artistic career to have been brought/stumbled/actively weaseled my way into this world. And I\u2019m totally smitten,\u201d he says.\nMore and more alt-rockers may follow, attracted by the chance to show their multi-hyphenate-ness and the constancy. No matter how successful a rock band is, life on the road means one or two nights in a city; a stage show, on the other hand, is more like a residency.\nMiller says he's also embraced the narrowness of the role. When he's writing for Guster, the song can be about anything. When he wrote for \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed,\u201d the songs had clear guidelines. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/book-review-deborah-levys-position-spoons-diehard-fans-114564285", "Title": "Book Review: Deborah Levy's 'The Position of Spoons' may be just for the diehard fans", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 10:58 AM", "content": "Deborah Levy is a celebrated novelist, memoirist and playwright whose latest book \u2014 \u201cThe Position of Spoons\u201d \u2014 is a petite collection of essays spanning the last few decades of her career.

Shkreli appealed an order to return $64.6 million in profits he and his former company reaped after monopolizing the market for the medication and drastically increasing its price. His lawyers argued that the money went to his company rather than him personally. \nThe justices did not explain their reasoning, as is typical, and there were no noted dissents. \nProsecutors, though, said the company had agreed in a settlement to pay $40 million, and because Shkreli masterminded the scheme he should bear responsibility for repaying profits. \nNew York Attorney General Letitia James applauded the court's action upholding the order, which also included a lifetime ban on Shkreli working in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cThis win reinforces how our state\u2019s tough anti-fraud laws help protect New Yorkers and ensure bad actors cannot abuse their power, wealth, or influence,\u201d she said in a statement. \nThomas Huff, a lawyer for Shkreli, said the decision was disappointing. But he also said the high court could yet overturn a lower court decision that made the $64 million penalty order possible even though Shkreli hadn\u2019t personally gotten the money.\n\u201cIf and when the Supreme Court does so, Mr. Shkreli will have a strong argument for modifying the order accordingly,\u201d he said. \nShkreli was also ordered to forfeit the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u201d the unreleased work that has been called the world\u2019s rarest musical album. The multiplatinum hip-hop group put a single copy of the album up for auction in 2015, on the condition that it not be put to commercial use. \nShkreli was convicted of lying to investors and cheating them out of millions of dollars in two failed hedge funds he operated.

After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision.\nBeyond the film\u2019s narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend\u2019s compassionate departure.\n\u201cIn my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha\u2019s position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),\u201d Swinton said.\nShe said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: \u201cNot only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.\u201d\nSwinton spoke to The Associated Press about \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d Almod\u00f3var and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\nSWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore\u2019s character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I\u2019ve been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha\u2019s attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it\u2019s possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we\u2019re talking about.\nIt really is a fool\u2019s errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it\u2019s not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It\u2019s an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living.\nSWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody\u2019s active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it\u2019s possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it\u2019s there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance.\nSWINTON: I\u2019d had a taste of it with short film, \u201cThe Human Voice.\u201d We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast\u2026 And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you\u2019re lucky.\nSWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it\u2019s possible to know Pedro\u2019s work. I\u2019ve known it since I was a student, and I\u2019ve loved it always. It\u2019s like a country. I love to go to the world of Almod\u00f3var and it\u2019s not Spain, it\u2019s somewhere else. It\u2019s his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s still a bit of a shock to us. When you\u2019re in an audience, that\u2019s the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you\u2019re standing next to Pedro Almod\u00f3var and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\nSWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I\u2019m ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That\u2019s like the weather. It\u2019s like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let\u2019s wait and see. Let\u2019s keep it real. Let\u2019s keep it today.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/robert-coover-innovative-author-teacher-dies-92-114550280", "Title": "Robert Coover, innovative author and teacher, dies at 92", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 6, 2024, 8:21 PM", "content": "NEW YORK -- Robert Coover, the exuberant and rule-defying fiction writer and educator who devised new adventures for literature through such works as \"The Babysitter\" and \"The Public Burning\" and through his decades on the faculty of Brown University, has died. He was 92. Coover died surrounded by family on Saturday at a care home in Warwick, England, his daughter Sara Caldwell told The Associated Press on Sunday. Caldwell, an author and filmmaker, said he had been in declining health in recent months. \nThe writer T.C. Boyle said on X that Coover had been \u201ca friend and mentor to me since I was in my early twenties. His first collection, \u2018Pricksongs and Descants,\u2019 opened up a new world for me.\u201d\nCoover was often grouped with William Gass, John Barth and other authors of post-modern or \"meta-fiction\" of the 1960s and '70s. They challenged and sometimes bludgeoned conventional storytelling and grammar, whether through experiments with language, the parody of fairy tales, mysteries and other literary genres or the self-conscious exploration of the writing process. Coover's trademarks included macabre humor, graphic sex, broad takes on everything from baseball to small towns and an encyclopedic range of cultural references.\n\"Robert Coover writes from life, but not the one he has lived out in the world,\" author Ben Marcus once wrote of him. \"He writes from his life as a reader of narratives. His personal experience, which he draws on for his work, is the experience he has had inside of texts. He did not grow up in Iowa, but in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses.' He did not suffer first love in the mid-west of America, but inside the Greek myths, or Aesop's fables, or 'The Decameron.'\"\nRarely without something to say, he wrote dozens of novels, stories and plays. His notable works included \"The Babysitter,\" in which a night out for the parents multiplies into a funhouse of alternative realities; \"You Must Remember This,\" an X-rated imagining of the leads in \"Casablanca,\" and the novel \"Huck Out West,\" in which Coover continued the adventures of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.\n\"A lesson I learned from reading (Thomas Pynchon's) 'V' has stuck with me all my life: All my work is basically comic,\" he told the Boston Globe in 2014. \"That's the only thing I have ever written. Even though they're not always viewed as such, the books are all meant as comic works.\"\nCoover's most controversial work was the 1977 novel \"The Public Burning,\" a warp-speed satire of the 1953 executions of convicted communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg that publishers hesitated to take on for fear of legal action by Richard Nixon, Roy Cohn and other then still-living historical figures who appear in the book. Coover alternated chapters about the Rosenbergs with the thoughts of then-Vice President Nixon, who laments his subservient role in the Eisenhower administration and confides to a growing sexual attraction between himself and Ethel Rosenberg.\n\"I was Eisenhower's salesman in the Cloakrooms, that was my job,\" Coover's Nixon explains. \"I was the political broker between the patsies and the Neanderthals, I had to cool the barnburners, soften up the hardshells, keep the hunkers and cowboys in line, mollify the soreheads and baby tinhorn egos. I was the flak runner, the wheelhorse, I had to mend the fences and bind up the wounds.\"\nCoover's influence was on the page and in the classroom. At Brown, where he was on the faculty from 1981 to 2012, those he taught included Rick Moody and Sam Lipsyte. Coover and such fellow professors as John Hawkes inspired students to experiment and break away from the kind of spare, realistic style \u2014 as exemplified by Ernest Hemingway \u2014 that was the standard in mainstream American fiction. \nFor Coover, anything seemed possible. He was an early believer that the written word could be integrated with music and film and digital technology and championed what he called \"Cave Writing,\" which included placing students in a virtual reality simulator. Before e-books were widely available, he helped found \"electronic literature,\" storytelling designed specifically for digital devices.\n\"What I saw quite clearly in the '80s, before the internet, was that the whole world was shifting toward digital formats, and that it didn't matter whether it's movies or writing or whatever,\" he told The Believer in 2015. \"It was something that was coming.\"\nHis honors included the William Faulkner Award for best debut fiction, given for his 1966 book \"The Origin of the Brunists.\u201d He also received the Rea Award for excellence in short story writing and the Clifton Fadiman Medal for fiction writers deserving of more recognition. The American Academy of Arts and Letters voted him in as a member and even had a prize named for him, the Robert Coover Award for an outstanding work of electronic literature.\nCoover is survived by Pilar Sans Coover, the tapestry artist he married in 1959, along with the couple\u2019s three children: Caldwell, Roderick Coover and Diana Hancox, who lived near their parents\u2019 care home in England. Caldwell said he had seven grandchildren, three great-granddaughters, and a great-grandson due this month who is set to be named after him.\nBorn in Charles City, Iowa, he graduated from Indiana University in 1953, served in the Navy and wrote for the Evergreen Review and other publications before completing his first novel. He would recall a night in Chicago in 1960 as an epiphany, when he was reading Saul Bellow's prize-winning \"The Adventures of Augie March\" and William Gaddis' experimental classic \"The Recognitions.\"\n\"I really loved 'Augie March.' The opening section, at least. But somewhere in the middle of the book the experience totally transformed, I was really ticked off. It was bad and getting worse. And I was really catching on to 'The Recognitions.' I took 'Augie March' and threw it across the room, and that was the last I saw of it,\" he told The Guardian in 2011.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/donald-glover-cancels-childish-gambino-tour-dates-after-114545553", "Title": "Donald Glover cancels Childish Gambino tour dates over health issue", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 6, 2024, 2:47 PM", "content": "Donald Glover has canceled the remaining dates of Childish Gambino\u2019s North American and European tour.The musician, actor and \u201cAtlanta\u201d creator announced on Friday that he recently discovered an ailment that required surgery.

The collapse was swift and has many in the industry wondering: How did the highly anticipated sequel to an Oscar-winning, billion-dollar film with the same creative team go wrong?\nJust three weeks ago, tracking services pegged the movie for a $70 million debut, which would still have been down a fair amount from \u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d record-breaking $96.2 million launch in Oct. 2019. Reviews were mixed out of the Venice Film Festival, where it premiered in competition like the first movie and even got a 12-minute standing ovation.\nBut the homecoming glow was short-lived, and the fragile foundation would crumble in the coming weeks with its Rotten Tomatoes score dropping from 63% at Venice to 33% by its first weekend in theaters. Perhaps even more surprising were the audience reviews: Ticket buyers polled on opening night gave the film a deadly D CinemaScore. Exit polls from PostTrak weren\u2019t any better. It got a meager half star out of five possible.\n\"That\u2019s a double whammy that\u2019s very difficult to recover from,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe biggest issue of all is the reported budget. A $40 or $50 million opening for a less expensive movie would be a solid debut.\"\n\u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d cost at least twice as much as the first film to produce, though reported figures vary at exactly how pricey it was to make. Phillips told Variety that it was less than the reported $200 million; Others have it pegged at $190 million. Warner Bros. released the film in 4,102 locations in North America. About 12.5% of its domestic total came from 415 IMAX screens.\nInternationally, it's earned $81.1 million from 25,788 screens, bringing its total global earnings estimate to $121.1 million. In the next two weeks, \u201cJoker 2\u201d will also open in Japan and China.\nSecond place went to Universal and DreamWorks Animation's\u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d which added $18.7 million in its second weekend, bringing its domestic total to nearly $64 million. Globally, it's made over $100 million. Warner Bros.' \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\" took third place in weekend five, Paramount's \u201cTransformers One\u201d landed in fourth and Universal and Blumhouse's \u201cSpeak No Evil\u201d rounded out the top five.\nThe other big new release of the weekend, Lionsgate's \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d flopped with just $1.5 million from just over 1,000 locations, despite an A+ CinemaScore.\nOverall, the weekend is up from the same frame last year, but \u201cJoker's\u201d start is an unwelcome twist for theater owners hoping to narrow the box office deficit. \nPhillips and star Joaquin Phoenix have said they aspired to make something as \u201caudacious\u201d as the first film. The sequel added Lady Gaga into the fold, as a Joker superfan, and delved further into the mind of Arthur Fleck, imprisoned at Arkham and awaiting trial for the murders he committed in the first. It\u2019s also a musical, with elaborately imagined song and dance numbers to old standards. Gaga even released a companion album called \u201c'Harlequin,\u201d alongside the film.\nIn his review for The Associated Press, Jake Coyle wrote that \u201cPhillips has followed his very antihero take on the Joker with a very anti-sequel. It combines prison drama, courthouse thriller and musical, and yet turns out remarkably inert given how combustible the original was.\u201d\nThe sequel has already been the subject of many think pieces, some who posit that the sequel was deliberately alienating fans of the first movie. In cruder terms, it\u2019s been called a \u201cmiddle finger.\u201d But fans often ignore the advice of critics, especially when it comes to opening their wallets to see revered comic book characters on the big screen.\n\u201cThey took a swing for the fences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBut except for a couple of outliers, audiences in 2024 seem to want to know what they\u2019re getting when they\u2019re going to the theater. They want the tried and true, the familiar.\u201d\nIt has some high-profile defenders too: Francis Ford Coppola, who last week got his own D+ CinemaScore for his pricey, ambitious and divisive film \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d entered the Joker chat with an Instagram post.\n\u201c@ToddPhillips films always amaze me and I enjoy them thoroughly,\u201d Coppola wrote. \u201cEver since the wonderful \u2018The Hangover\u2019 he\u2019s always one step ahead of the audience never doing what they expect.\u201d\n\u201cMegalopolis,\u201d meanwhile, dropped a terminal 74% in its second weekend with just over $1 million, bringing its total just shy of $6.5 million against a $120 million budget. \nDeadline editor Anthony D\u2019Alessandro thinks the problem started with the idea to make the Joker sequel a musical. \u201cNo fan of the original movie wanted to see a musical sequel,\u201d he wrote on Saturday.\nThe first film was also divisive and the subject of much discourse, then about whether it might send the wrong message to the wrong type of person. And yet people still flocked to see what the fuss was about. \u201cJoker\u201d went on to pick up 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director, and three wins. It also made over $1 billion and was the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until this summer when Marvel's \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\" took the crown.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

The discussion with Harris was on the tame side for the show, with the vice president keeping her message focused, in part, on the value of ignoring people who have doubted her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear no. I urge all the \u2018Daddy Gang,\u2019 don\u2019t hear no, just don\u2019t hear it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important not to let other people define you.\u201d\nThe interview was part of a broader media outreach effort by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as the Democrats seek to boost their support in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.\nHarris has been criticized for not doing more media interviews. \nOn the podcast, the Democratic nominee largely stuck to her usual messaging on abortion, and said that in her travels she's seen that even people who have strong opposition to abortion tell her they \u201care now seeing what\u2019s happening and saying \u2018Hmm, I didn\u2019t intend for all this to happen' \u201d when they see the health problems arising since Roe v. Wade was repealed.\nHarris dinged Trump as she has in recent speeches, leaning in on his integrity and saying \u201cthis guy is full of lies\u201d when he talks about abortion and other issues. She dismissed Vance\u2019s comments about \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d as \u201cmean, and mean-spirited.\u201d\nTrump has continued to stress that abortion policy should be left to the states and that doctors have a duty to provide emergency care to women whose lives are in danger. Vance, for his part, has said his remark about childless women were misinterpreted and that he wants to support families. \nThere's much more to come from Harris and Walz. \nHarris has taped an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern\u2019s satellite radio show, ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s ABC show on Monday.\nIn a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d excerpt released Sunday, Harris navigated around a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \u201ca real close ally,\u201d saying that \u201cThe better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\u201d\nAnd nearly a week after his verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and to \u201cown up\u201d to past misstatements.\nWalz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.\nWalz said Sunday that \u201cspecific operations will be dealt with at the time\u201d and he spoke of \u201dconsequences for what they do.\" \nHe said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nWalz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it \"puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers.\u201d \nTrump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law, and during the interview Sunday, Walz was asked whether he was calling that \u201ca flat-out lie.\u201d\n\u201cYes ... of course,\u201d Walz said.\nWalz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements related to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\u201cI will own up when I misspeak,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI will own up when I make a mistake.\u201d\nHe said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could be restrictions on the infertility treatments, like the intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,\" Walz said. \"So I think folks know who I am.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/magical-flotilla-hot-air-balloons-flight-international-fiesta-114530543", "Title": "'Magical' flotilla of hot air balloons take flight at international fiesta amid warm temperatures", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 5, 2024, 1:44 PM", "content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A flotilla of hot air balloons ascended into a clear desert sky on Saturday to kick off a colorful mass ascension at the 52nd annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.The nine-day gathering draws hundreds of thousands of spectators and pilots to New Mexico each fall for the rare opportunity to be within arm\u2019s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated.\nBalloons took flight to screams of delight after a brief weather delay and were spirited away by a gentle breeze.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis paid tribute to Plessas, writing, \u201cA leading composer, a great scholar and a kind man has left us.\nBorn in Athens on Oct. 12, 1924, Plessas began his musical journey at a young age.
